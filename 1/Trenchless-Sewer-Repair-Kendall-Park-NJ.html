<p>Covert water leaks are often stressful and have Potentially Major Effects. Replacing your flapper may need somewhat various steps than we show (Pictures 2 and 3). Your flapper might screw onto a threaded rod or have a ring that slips over the overflow tube. If you have an uncommon flush valve, finding a replacement flapper might be the hardest part of the job. To find an ideal replacement, shut off the water, take the old one with you to the home center or hardware store. (Switch off the water before eliminating the flapper.) You may not discover an identical match, but opportunities are you'll find among the exact same shape and diameter. If not, attempt a plumbing supply store (in the Yellow Pages under Plumbing Supplies") or search online.</p>

Pinch the spring clip and slide the float up or down to set the water level 1 in. listed below the top of the overflow tube or to the water line marked on the tank.</p>
