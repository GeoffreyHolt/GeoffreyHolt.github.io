<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Rather than a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has actually been sized to deal with peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to effectively adapt to your organisation' circulation rates throughout the day. Throughout durations of high circulation demand, tanks come online to add flow rate capacity. During durations of low circulation need, tanks go off-line. This brand-new method to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation innovation, and it's arguably the most essential innovation in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
