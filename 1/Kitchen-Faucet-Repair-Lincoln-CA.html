<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Rather than a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to manage peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently get used to your organisation' circulation rates throughout the day. During periods of high flow demand, tanks come online to add flow rate capacity. During durations of low flow need, tanks go off-line. This new method to softening is called responsive or progressive circulation innovation, and it's probably the most important innovation in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
