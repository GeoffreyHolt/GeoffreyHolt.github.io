<p>Once the components are positioned back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is ready to be pressurized. It is necessary to turn the inlet shut-off valve on gradually while the drawback shut down stays in the closed position. This enables the parts to transfer to their pressurized positions in an accurate movement. When the assembly is pressurized, then any built up air must be eliminated from the body. Most backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be gotten rid of from critical areas in the assembly. In some designs, test cocks can be used to get rid of air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in an area where the air will collect.</p>
