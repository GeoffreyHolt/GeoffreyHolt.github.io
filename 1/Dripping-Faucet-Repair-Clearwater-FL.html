<p>Wire the disposal. Some disposals include appliance wires attached, and others do not.

<p>Recently we were called by a couple to unclog a main sewer line in between their brand-new home and the city sewer. After clearing the drain we utilized our sewer camera to examine the line and determine the cause of the problem. The line was clearly weakening; some sections were only held together by the ground around them. Another clog loomed. Even worse, the line might collapse requiring a major repair or replacement.</p>
