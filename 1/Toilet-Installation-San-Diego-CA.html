<p>Backflow Preventer: A device that enables water to go through it in one direction, however avoids it from going backwards in the opposite direction.

Outdoors blockages - Heavy rains can quickly result in a need for drain cleaning. Outdoors drains are normally not designed to handle big volumes of water, and can easily become blocked due to particles such as dirt and leaves.</p>
<p>When the parts are put back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is prepared to be pressurized. It is necessary to turn the inlet shut-off valve on gradually while the drawback shut down remains in the closed position. This permits the parts to transfer to their pressurized positions in a precise motion. As soon as the assembly is pressurized, then any collected air needs to be gotten rid of from the body. A lot of backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be eliminated from crucial areas in the assembly. In some designs, test dicks can be used to eliminate air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in an area where the air will accumulate.</p>
