If yours is getting old, this post is likewise for you. If you're helpful with standard tools and have a bit of experience soldering copper, changing a water heater isn't difficult.</p>
<p>One of the most major hot water heater problems is leaking water, which is sometimes caused by defective temperature level and pressure (T&P) relief valves.

<p>To prep your unit for installation, you might have to attach a cable with a plug to reach the outlet, or extension wires to reach a hardwired box In this case, I connected a cord with a plug set that I purchased separately from the disposal system. It's as easy as feeding the wires from the cord through the disposal and connecting them to the matching colors on the unit with wire nuts.</p>
<p>Although these property owners didn't feel lucky at the time, it was certainly great timing to camera the line prior to collapsing.

At the least, it would have been a very expensive option.</p>
