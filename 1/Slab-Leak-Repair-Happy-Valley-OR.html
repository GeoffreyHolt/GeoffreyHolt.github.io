<p>The leak from a pipe fitting that costs less than a dollar can easily cause countless dollars in water damage, interrupt your household for weeks, and toss your remodel way off schedule. So employing a licensed, insured master plumber (or a well-trained apprentice working under his license) is a no-brainer. But not all plumbers manage all types of work.

<p>Next comes the metal install ring and rubber cushion mount (or cushion ring). Their correct orientation will be identified. These two pieces have complementary grooves that when correctly fitted together hold the install ring and disposal in place. Holding the install ring at the upper part of the flange, work the cushion mount over the bottom of the flange, ensuring that the rubber of the cushion mount is fully and firmly locking into the groove on the bottom of the flange. When set up correctly, you need to not be able to eliminate the cushion mount without significant extending and pulling, and the install ring should turn freely around it.</p>
