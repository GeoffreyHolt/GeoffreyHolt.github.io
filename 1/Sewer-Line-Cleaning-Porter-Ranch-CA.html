The primary kinds of mechanical backflow preventer are the reduced-pressure concept assembly, the pressure vacuum breaker assembly, and the double check valve assembly.

It is essential to go out in front of any problems as fast as possible. The quicker you react to a problem, the better chance you'll have to conserve time and money on water heater services.</p>
