<p>Concealed water leakages are often stressful and have Possibly Major Repercussions. Replacing your flapper may require a little different steps than we show (Images 2 and 3).

To discover a suitable replacement, switch off the water, take the old one with you to the home center or hardware store. (Shut off the water before removing the flapper.) You might not find an identical match, but chances are you'll locate among the same shape and size. If not, attempt a plumbing supply shop (in the Telephone Directory under Plumbing Supplies") or search online.</p>
