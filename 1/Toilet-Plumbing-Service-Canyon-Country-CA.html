<p>Wooden pipes were utilized in London and in other places during the 17th and 16th centuries. The pipes were hollowed-out logs which were tapered at the end with a little hole in which the water would go through. 21 The several pipes were then sealed together with hot animal fat. Wooden pipes were utilized in Philadelphia, 22 Boston, and Montreal in the 1800s. Built-up wooden tubes were commonly utilized in the USA during the 20th century. These pipes (utilized in place of corrugated iron or strengthened concrete pipes) were made of sections cut from short lengths of wood. Locking of surrounding rings with hardwood dowel pins produced a flexible structure. About 100,000 feet of these wooden pipes were installed during WW2 in drainage culverts, storm drains and conduits, under highways and at army camps, marine stations, airfields and ordnance plants.</p>
<p>State you choose to go that path. The next question is whether or not you can install it yourself. Put it this way, if you're a skilled useful individual, however you've never handled this specific repair, you can probably do it, providing you do your homework. I would draw the line at attempting to install a power-vented gas-fired hot water heater (and some other specialized designs). Their installation ought to be handled by a licensed mechanical or plumbing contractor.</p>
