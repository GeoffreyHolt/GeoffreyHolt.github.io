<p>Water softeners overcome a process called ion exchange which gets rid of calcium and magnesium from the water. When the tough water enters into the mineral tank, it streams through a bed of round resin beads These plastic beads, generally made from polystyrene, are charged with a salt ion. The resin beads are anions, indicating they have a negative charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a favorable charge, making them cations. Given that opposite charges draw in, the unfavorable charge of the minerals is drawn in to the favorable charge of the resin beads. As the tough water goes through the resin, the beads get ahold of the mineral ions and eliminate them from the water. When the bead takes the mineral ion, the salt ion is released. The column of resin strips all the firmness out of the water as it goes through the mineral tank, and softened water drains into your home.</p>
