Salt ions are held loosely and are changed easily by calcium and magnesium ions. Throughout this procedure, free" salt ions are released into the water. The time between recharging cycles depends on the firmness of the water, the quantity of water utilized, the size of the unit and the capability of the exchange media to get rid of solidity.</p>
