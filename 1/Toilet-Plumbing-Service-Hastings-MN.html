<p>The function of the Plumbing Inspection Program is to ensure that all plumbing installed during building of a brand-new or remodelled building is set up by experienced craftsmen in accordance with suitable codes.

Ninety percent of energy produced by natural gas is provided to the consumer through gas lines. This is an effective means to receive energy to the home.</p>
