Ion exchange increases the amount of salt in water, in order to decrease its mineral content.

More difficult water will lead to more salt, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For the majority of people, this increase in sodium is small, but if you've been recommended by a physician to follow a rigorous low sodium diet plan this boost can position problems.</p>
