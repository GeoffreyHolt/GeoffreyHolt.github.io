<p>You might be dealing with regular plumbing problems if you're living in an old home that's never ever been renovated. Even if you do not have considerable problems, it's a good idea to repipe your home to secure your home and avoid more substantial issues in the future. Here are signs saying you need a repipe company.</p>
<p>To prep your system for installation, you might need to attach a cable with a plug to reach the outlet, or extension wires to reach a hardwired box In this case, I connected a cord with a plug set that I purchased separately from the disposal unit. It's as basic as feeding the wires from the cable through the disposal and connecting them to the matching colors on the system with wire nuts.</p>
<p>If there's an existing disposal, use the useful self-service wrenchette to disengage the old unit from the bottom of the sink. It will fit in the holes on bottom piece of the bracket. Twist the bottom piece clockwise while supporting the bottom to get it free. Several houses in my neighborhood being repiped and have actually spoken with next-door neighbors about the problems leading up to this. If the leak isn't discovered soon, apparently it begins with pin hole leakages in the copper piping and can cause major damage.</p>
