<p>Though water line replacement sounds like your house's equivalent of significant surgery, it's in fact something we at Gotelli Plumbing deal with often. When your water lines are repiped, it simply suggests old copper and galvanized pipes are replaced with new pipes. We discover that houses 15 years or older who have never had repiping work are the most likely candidates for water line replacement.

The line was plainly degrading; some areas were just held together by the ground around them. Another clog was imminent. Even even worse, the line might collapse needing a significant repair or replacement.</p>
