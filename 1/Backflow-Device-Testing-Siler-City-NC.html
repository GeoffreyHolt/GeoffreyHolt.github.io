It is important to turn the inlet shut-off valve on slowly while the drawback shut down stays in the closed position. This allows the parts to relocate to their pressurized positions in a precise motion. When the assembly is pressurized, then any accumulated air needs to be removed from the body. A lot of backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be gotten rid of from critical locations in the assembly. In some designs, test cocks can be used to eliminate air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in a location where the air will accumulate.</p>
