<p>All piping under sinks and faucets are looked for leakages or damage. How to tell if you have polybutylene pipes: If your pipes are white plastic and include the letters PB" in the printed label, you have polybutylene pipes and we suggest having them changed right away. Before you can ask for an inspection, you should initially obtain the needed permit( s) for the work you plan to do. You can check out our Permit page to learn more on getting a license. Once you get an authorization you can start with the work. However, you need to require inspection prior to you cover or hide any work.</p>
