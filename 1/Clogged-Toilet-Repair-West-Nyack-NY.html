Fire security system are designed to match the risk that exists in the locations they are installed in. As structure types and contents of these structures can be extremely various, we need to understand that the fire protection system for any installation needs to be created and installed to fulfill that particular hazard or need. An airplane hangar will need an extremely different fire defense system than the system required in an apartment building. The backflow defense requirements for these two examples would also vary significantly.</p>
