<p>Garbage disposal guarantees last an average of 5 years, however they can range between 2 and 10 years. Since the average lifespan of a garbage disposal is 12 years, you may wish to purchase an extended guarantee. A lot of warranties cover the cost to repair and replace normal wear and tear failures. To prevent more breakdowns, property owners must keep up with regular maintenance of their waste disposal unit.</p>
<p>Maintenance is another factor to consider. While you can buy models with special features that do whatever however add the salt, you will pay for each additional function. The tradeoff will be cost for convenience and you have no longterm warranty that the special function will not fail.

Estimates show that about 50 gallons of water are used for each regeneration cycle. This may or may not trigger hydraulic overload of the septic system.</p>
