Plumbing problems aren't just hard to find, they're likewise efficient in causing some severe damage. Pinhole leakages, for instance, are so small that they just launch a number of droplets at a time. That's far too small to cause a drop in water pressure, or any of the other symptoms that might caution of a leak in the system.
