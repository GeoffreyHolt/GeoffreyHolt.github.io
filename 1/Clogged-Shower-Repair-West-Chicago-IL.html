<p>After professional drain cleaning, there are a couple of things you can do to keep your drains clear. Avoid putting grease or oil down the drains. Use a solution of baking soda and vinegar periodically to keep your drains and garbage disposal clean. You can use a natural drain cleaner monthly to keep your drains clear. We recommend organic items, such as Bio-Clean, since they work better than items consisting of harsh chemicals and will not cause damage to your drains or components.</p>

<p>The main difference among water softener models is in the way they arrange the backflush cycles.

See your owner's handbook for directions on bypassing your softener. Numerous brand-new homes are built with PEX and not copper.</p>
