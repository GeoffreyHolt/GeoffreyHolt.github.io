<p>When compared to gas designs, electrical designs are simpler and more economical to install as electrical energy is already readily available through the main power supply line. For gas water heaters, a particular gas line needs to be installed and a practical source of gas developed. Another function of an electrical water heater is that they do not require any ventilation.

<p>Throughout typical operation, the pressure between the 2 check valves, referred to as the zone of reduced pressure, is preserved at a lower pressure than the supply pressure. If either check valve need to leak, the relief valve is designed to open and release water to the exterior. An RPZ will occasionally discharge percentages of water due to variation in line pressure up or downstream of the assembly. For this reason, the RPZ should be installed in areas that are not subject to water damage and permit appropriate drainage.</p>
