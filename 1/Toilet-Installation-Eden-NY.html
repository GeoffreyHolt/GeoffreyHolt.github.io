<p>To prep your unit for installation, you may need to attach a cord with a plug to reach the outlet, or extension wires to reach a hardwired box In this case, I connected a cord with a plug package that I purchased independently from the disposal unit. It's as easy as feeding the wires from the cable through the disposal and attaching them to the matching colors on the system with wire nuts.</p>
<p>How much is a sewer line inspection? These specialized assessments include specialized camera devices that encounters your sewer line. A camera inspection is much more palatable than trenching through the backyard if you've identified pooling water in the yard. This will cost you (typically) in between $300-$ 400.
