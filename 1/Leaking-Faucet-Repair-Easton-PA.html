<p>Another downside of water softening through ion exchange is the potential health danger for individuals on low salt diets. Ion exchange increases the amount of sodium in water, in order to reduce its mineral material. Usually, this procedure adds 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending on how difficult the water was to start with.
