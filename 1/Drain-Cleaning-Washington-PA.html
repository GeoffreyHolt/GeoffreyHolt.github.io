Low water pressure might make your morning shower less than invigorating.</p>
<p>Prevention is better than remedy. If you have a well or an irrigation system, you need to install a backflow device on your water system. Discolored water- Your water needs to always be clear. Discolored water signifies rust in your pipes or hot water heater. This warrants professional attention if your water is an uncommon color.
