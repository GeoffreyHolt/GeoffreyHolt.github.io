<p>After getting here after their window, they started to examine the kitchen sink (and after among the 2 gentlemen threw up outside), they ran a snake down the sink and after that put the sink back together but claimed they would not take obligation if it dripped now due to the fact that of some undefined oddities in how my sink was created. After they offered me the "do not pour grease down the sink" lecture and they left, I observed they managed to reassemble the sink in such a manner in which the sprayer hose was wrapped around the plumbing. I didn't even bother to attempt calling them back, because I never wish to see this company once again.</p>
