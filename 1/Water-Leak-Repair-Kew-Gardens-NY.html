<h3>Professional Experience Is Essential For A Good Plumber Kew Gardens NY</h3>
<p>Root Invasion: Root intrusion refers to what occurs when tree roots begin to grow around and into your drain and sewer lines This happens since the wetness in these lines is a natural fertilizer for tree roots. When roots eventually do piece your drain lines, they can cause obstructions, breaks, and back-ups which may result in substantial property damage. Look out for damp, green patches in your backyard, a persistent sewage smell in or around your house, an uptick in insect and rodent activity, and slow drains, as these are all common indications of root invasion.</p>
<p>Hydro jetting is a procedure in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at approximately 3,500 PSI. This permits the sewer lines to be cleaned up quickly and effectively with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, emitting from the forward and reverse jets in the nozzle, move the hose through the line to remove debris such as difficult water scale, silt, sand, and grease deposits.</p>
