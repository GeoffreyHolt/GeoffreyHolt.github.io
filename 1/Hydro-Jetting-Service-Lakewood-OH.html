<p>When you have a clogged piping system in your Miami, Florida facilities, you can either select a plumber who digs up your backyard, excavates the walls and tears up the structure throughout the pipe repairs, or you can have the insight to work with a professional such as Eco 1 Plumbing. Cross-linked polyethylene (PEX) is the latest product being used to replace PVC pipes. It is typically utilized to replace copper pipes as well and is used for a number of other plumbing applications. PEX pipes are known to be more heat resistant than other types of piping. They are considered safe and are regularly used to carry drinking water in brand-new buildings.</p>
