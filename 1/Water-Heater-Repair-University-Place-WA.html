<p>When choosing the proper system security there are several factors to consider we need to take a look at. In my mind there is nobody size fits all situations in the cross-connection world. Each and every installation needs to be taken a look at on a specific basis as a distinct stand-alone system. The National Fire Security Association NFPA 13 Standard for the installation of lawn sprinkler includes the requirement for the sprinkler systems themselves. Fire protection system are created to match the danger that exists in the areas they are installed in. As structure types and contents of these structures can be very various, we need to understand that the fire protection system for any installation needs to be developed and set up to fulfill that particular danger or need. An aircraft hangar will need a really various fire defense system than the system required in an apartment building. The backflow defense requirements for these 2 examples would also vary significantly.</p>
