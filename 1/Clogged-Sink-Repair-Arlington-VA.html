<p>The majority of houses or buildings that were built in the 1970s generally have galvanized piping. In time, the plumbing system can break and the pipes can begin to wear away. This can cause low water pressure and impact the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping includes iron pipes that have been coded with zinc to offer weather defense. As the external finish of zinc starts to erode, the pipe is exposed to water and wetness, triggering the iron to eventually rust.</p>

Even even worse, the line could collapse requiring a major repair or replacement.</p>
