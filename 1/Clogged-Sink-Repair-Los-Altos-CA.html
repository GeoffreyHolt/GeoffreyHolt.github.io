Private service pipelines are generally made from plastic, lead or Type K copper. And it is here at the point of application where the installation of a backflow preventer can be crucial.</p>
<p>Water softener systems work by eliminating solidity minerals and replacing them with sodium ions. Water conditioners are devices that help avoid the hardness-forming minerals from forming scale. They utilize a physical media to inhibit the scale from building up by reducing the effects of the solidity itself. Due to the reality that water conditioners use a physical media instead of a chemical media, they are sometimes thought about a greener alternative in locations where it is forbidden to utilize salt. Water conditioners do not effectively eliminate hardness from the water supply, however, as the only method to do this is with a salt-based media.</p>

<p>During typical operation, the pressure in between the 2 check valves, referred to as the zone of decreased pressure, is maintained at a lower pressure than the supply pressure. The relief valve is designed to open and release water to the outside if either check valve should leak. An RPZ will occasionally discharge small amounts of water due to fluctuation in line pressure up or downstream of the assembly. For this reason, the RPZ needs to be set up in locations that are not subject to water damage and enable adequate drainage.</p>
