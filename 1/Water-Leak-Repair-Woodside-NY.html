<p>Badly set up gas lines result in gas leakages. Gas leakages are expensive to repair. Gas line installation is not a do-it-yourself task.

It is the 2nd highest energy consuming area of a home, next to heating and cooling. The amount of minerals dissolved in water can cause it to take longer for water to heat, increasing those energy expenses.</p>

I in fact received their number for another company that couldn't come quickly enough but referred me to Rate Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to investigate and offer me a quote. They instantly cleared the initial blockage, enabling the renters to return from a hotel. Regrettably, upon more examination, there was a considerable clog that needed excavation to investigate. His group was on site the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this preliminary concern and installing a protective liner, it was determined that there was yet another break existed.
