Unlike a drip leg, the circulation of the gas is altered to remove any sediment. A sediment trap may be included in a drip leg install.

These gadgets go through testing by a qualified backflow prevention assembly tester upon installation. In a lot of cases, they undergo routine tests later, too.</p>
