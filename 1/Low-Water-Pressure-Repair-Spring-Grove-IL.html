<p>The repair service technician should be able to identify the many different makers and the particular designs produced for many years. Some models might seem similar on the outdoors however could need different repair parts on the inside, so the repair technician need to have the ability to identify the make, design and size of the backflow prevention assembly and any variations that might have been produced. Sometimes the identification number of the assembly will be needed to separate one design from another. It is essential to know the right model to guarantee you get the right repair parts.</p>
<p>A plumbing permit attends to three inspections. Additional inspections are $50.00 each.

<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is only half the equation! To simply pour some media inside a tank and expect the very best is typical in our market and lots of companies attempt to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Again, years of experience and extensive testing led us to design a tank that fluidizes the media bed better than any other design on the market. Fluidization is the essential to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media transforms the solidity in the water to calcite crystals which will not stick to anything even under severe temperature levels. It's just with the media and the fluidization effectively working together that you can accomplish this.</p>
