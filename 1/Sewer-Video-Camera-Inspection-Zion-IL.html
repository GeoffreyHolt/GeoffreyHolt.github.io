<h3>The 5 Most Useful Tools For De-Clogging in Zion IL</h3>
<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to run, the control valve or valves need to stay open and the system must be continuously monitored. For that reason, there is a device on each control valve that either prevents the valve from being closed or sends an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as basic as a locked chain through the control valve that avoids that valve from opening, or an alarm that informs the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems utilize both techniques. NFPA 13 refers to all such gadgets as supervisory devices.</p>
