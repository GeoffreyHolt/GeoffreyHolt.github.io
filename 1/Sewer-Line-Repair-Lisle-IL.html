<p>In 1939, after his Roto-Rooter sewer cleaning machine proved effective, Sam Blanc created and built a smaller design that ran on the exact same principle but might clean and clear bathroom and kitchen sink drains as well as laundry drains and other household plumbing drains. Blanc likewise constructed a much larger variation of the Roto-Rooter machine called the Roto-Rooter Royal. It needed to be towed by a truck and featured a 10 hp fuel engine and 1000 feet of steel cable. It was capable of cleaning big industrial and community sewer pipes. An improved version called "The Mainliner" was introduced in 1958 that might also thread telephone cable. It was discontinued in 1973.</p>
