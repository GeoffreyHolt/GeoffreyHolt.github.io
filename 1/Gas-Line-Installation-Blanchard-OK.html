When hard water goes through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (solidity) ions are gotten rid of through an ion exchange process, so just softened water passes through to your home. Once the resin bed fills up with firmness ions, it should be regenerated (cleaned). Salt is usually used in the regeneration process and brings back the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange process can start once again.</p>
