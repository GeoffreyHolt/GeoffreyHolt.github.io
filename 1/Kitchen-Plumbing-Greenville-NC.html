<p>If you're buying a new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the huge majority of toilets, the drain is centered about 12 in. from the wall. However with a couple of models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To check the rough-in, simply determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't roughly 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. A lot of house centers bring just one or two 10-in. models and no 14-in. designs. If you have to special-order a toilet, be prepared to spend a lot more. Also measure how far the bowl extends from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are replacing a toilet with a basic bowl with an elongated" design, the door might not close. Continue reading to find out how to install a toilet.</p>
<p>There's a great opportunity it's because the garbage disposal is clogged if the sink is no longer draining as rapidly as it as soon as did.

To prevent even more, more-costly repairs (like water damage from burst pipes), you might wish to think about repiping your entire home when you spot a leak.</p>
