<p>Backflow preventers need to just be repaired when the data collected from the field test suggests the assembly has degraded in its efficiency listed below the established minimum standard. The test treatment is a diagnostic examination of the operations of a backflow preventer. When the backflow preventer stops working to satisfy this minimum standard, the backflow preventer should be fixed or if essential, replaced. These minimum requirements are set at a level that as the backflow prevention assembly begins to deteriorate in its performance, it can still avoid backflow. The function of a repair is to return the assembly back to its initial factory working requirements. This implies the assembly is repaired so that it can perform above the minimum requirement.</p>
