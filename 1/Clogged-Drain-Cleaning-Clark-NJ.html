<p>In the long run, a gas heater might be a less expensive alternative than an electrical, but the initial cost of the installation and the heater can be considerably higher. A gas heater also requires a bit more to effectively keep throughout the years than an electrical heater will. In the end, the expenses conserved for many years will more than cover the expenses of water for a larger household. Smaller sized households and people might do much better with an electric hot water heater, or an on-demand tankless" water heater as described in the area listed below.</p>

For this factor, the RPZ must be set up in areas that are exempt to water damage and enable adequate drainage.</p>
