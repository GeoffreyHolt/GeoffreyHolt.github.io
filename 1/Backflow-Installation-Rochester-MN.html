<p>As the water treatment industry has actually grown in the U.S., the principle of water softening has typically been misinterpreted as a purifying, cleansing or conditioning procedure. This is due largely to exaggerated advertising and, in part, to consumer mistaken beliefs about water treatment. But the truth is that water softening just gets rid of hardness minerals and gets rid of problems that are a nuisance and not a risk to human health. The decision "to soften or not to soften" refers individual preference not requirement. However, water softening does have advantages, and drawbacks, that make this choice a considerable one.</p>
<p>Tankless units last 5-10 years longer than tanked systems and need less repairs with time.

Throughout regrowth, salty water from the brine tank flows up the fill tube and into the softener tank. A rinse cycle commences and the salty water cleans the mineral deposits off the resin beads.

Lime softening increases the pH of the water, which creates an inhospitable environment for disease-causing germs. This is the very first barrier in the Cedar Rapids Water Department's multi-barrier disinfection procedure.</p>
