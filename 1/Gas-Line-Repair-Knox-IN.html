Supplied there isn't a tank failure, typically a commercial water heater can be fixed, but is it worth repairing? Only after addressing the following concerns must you answer repair or replace. Do you understand the number of years old your water heater is? Do you know the number of years it's rated for?

<p>We had an excellent experience with Joe Boyette, he was very professional, polite, proficient. We had a great deal of plumbing repair after a fire for over a 2 month period. We also needed to replace a water and a bathroom heater unassociated to the fire, but we felt great in Joe's abilities. We decided to stick with Joe, even though we felt Mr Rooter prices were certainly on the high end. This being posted by Barbara Boyer from Atlanta.</p>
