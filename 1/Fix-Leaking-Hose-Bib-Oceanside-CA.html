<h3>Emergency Plumbing Repair Oceanside CA</h3>

Points at which a safe and clean water system gets in touch with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashers, however they should be thoroughly designed and installed to prevent backflow. Another common location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the public water supply.</p>
