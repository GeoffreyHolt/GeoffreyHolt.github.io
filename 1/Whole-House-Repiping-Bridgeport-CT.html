Backsiphonage is backflow caused by a negative pressure (i.e., a vacuum or partial vacuum) in a public water system or customer's safe and clean water system. The result resembles drinking water through a straw. Backsiphonage can happen when there is an interruption of water supply due to neighboring firefighting, a break in a water pipe, etc</p>
<p>The need for backflow preventers is apparent, but how do they work and which styles are best for certain applications? Frequently the type and installation requirements are spelled out by environmental regulations and local statutes. Local building regulations for example will need a vertical separation of a minimum of one inch to form an air gap between a faucet opening and the highest possible water level in its sink or basin. The resultant gap breaks any prospective siphon before it can happen, preventing contaminating water from being sucked back into the pipe system. Other laws can require the installation of more sophisticated and complicated backflow preventers. And the design of these mechanical gadgets set up to prevent backflow range from the reasonably easy to the complicated and extremely advanced.</p>
