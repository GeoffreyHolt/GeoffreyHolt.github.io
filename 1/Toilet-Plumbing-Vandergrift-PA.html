<h3>What Services Do Plumbers Provide Vandergrift PA</h3>
<p>The most effective way to attend to hard water is with a water softener. Water is softened when calcium and magnesium-- the firmness ions-- are collected by tiny resin beads through a procedure called ion exchange. The resin beads are charged with salt or potassium ions. When tough water is available in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are pulled out of the water and replaced with sodium or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>Nothing can provide a home soft water like a water softener. And the advantages of treating that water even with a water softener far out weigh the damages brought on by our really difficult water.
