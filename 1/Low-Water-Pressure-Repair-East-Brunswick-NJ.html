<h3>Drain Cleaning Techniques in East Brunswick NJ</h3>
<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to operate, the control valve or valves should stay open and the system should be constantly monitored. Therefore, there is a device on each control valve that either avoids the valve from being closed or sends out an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as basic as a locked chain through the control valve that prevents that valve from opening, or an alarm system that notifies the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems use both techniques. NFPA 13 refers to all such gadgets as supervisory devices.</p>
