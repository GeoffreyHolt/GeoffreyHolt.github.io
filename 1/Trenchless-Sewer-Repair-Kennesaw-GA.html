<p>Tru-Soft Â® Solar Salt water Blocks are produced for the requirements of lots of water softener units. Current Review: Howard, the Project Supervisor, has always been informative and handy concerning all our concerns. He did the proposition and arranged the work for the clear out and partial sewer line repair immediately. It is always a pleasure to work with him.

He is constantly enjoyable, professional and goes above and beyond.</p>
<p>Next, test the flapper as displayed in Photo 1. Water is most likely leaving through a broken or corroded overflow tube if additional pressure on the flapper does not stop the running noise.
