<p>Plumbing is the practice, fixtures and materials used in the installation, maintenance, extension, and alteration of all piping, fixtures, plumbing appliances, and plumbing appurtenances in connection with sanitary drainage or storm drainage centers; venting systems and personal or public water system systems, within or adjacent to any building or structure.</p>
<p>The majority of houses or buildings that were built in the 1970s generally have galvanized piping. In time, the plumbing system can wear and the pipes can start to wear away. This can trigger low water pressure and impact the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping includes iron pipes that have actually been coded with zinc to provide weather condition protection. As the external covering of zinc starts to erode, the pipe is exposed to water and moisture, triggering the iron to ultimately rust.</p>
<p>A cross connection is a connection between a safe and clean drinking supply of water and a possible source of contamination or pollution. Under the provisions of the Safe Drinking Water Act of 1971, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) established national standards for safe drinking water. Each state is required to implement the different regulations of the Safe Drinking Water Act and how it connects to its state laws.</p>
