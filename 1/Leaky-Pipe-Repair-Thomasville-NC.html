<p>The EcoWater ESS1152 Series are non-resin based systems that can be tailored to your water needs. Your EcoWater Pro will evaluate your water to determine the ideal water treatment for your house. Due to the fact that the softener's salt water tank nests inside of the salt tank, a single tank or cabinet-style system requires less area. The CareSoft Â® system was developed with the exact same sophisticated engineering as the Pro and Elite designs, with resin that provides high-performance hardness removal you can depend on for years to come.</p>
<p>Prevention is much better than treatment. If you have a well or a watering system, you need to install a backflow device on your water supply.

Both will produce a good seal (though the gasket may lead to small amounts of water collecting around the flange), and what's utilized is mostly a matter of choice. Some even prefer silicone sealant, though it's harder to eliminate.</p>
