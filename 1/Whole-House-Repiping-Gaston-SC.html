<p>Backpressure backflow is triggered by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's safe and clean water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the potable water supply pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the potable water system pressure, or a combination of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be developed by pumps, temperature level increases in boilers, etc. Reductions in potable water system pressure happen whenever the quantity of water being utilized exceeds the quantity of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>

<p>However, you also need to consider the age of your unit. If your system is getting near ten years old, it's typically not wise to spend for repairs if they deserve more than half of the cost of a brand-new unit.
