<p>Rust is an intricate phenomenon and there are lots of aspects that speed up corrosion in the drinking-water distribution system and premise plumbing. For several years, there has been confusion surrounding cation -exchange softened water and corrosion, making it important to distinguish between naturally soft water and cation -exchange softened water Naturally soft water is corrosive as it has a low pH and low TDS; however, cation -exchange water softening does not contribute to any factors that accelerate deterioration Also, there is a lack of scientific proof supporting the claim that hard-water scale is a reliable type of corrosion control. Hence, considering all these factors, as well as arise from research studies, WQA's position is that an effectively configured cation -exchange water softener does not make water more corrosive.</p>
