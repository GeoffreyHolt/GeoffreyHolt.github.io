The Pipe Pull method interchanges harmed sewer or water lines with brand-new piping by the use of a tiny hole at the front and back of the piping run. The broken sewer line guides the new piping into location. All new replacement pipes have a forecasted life-span of one hundred years and are code certified, chemical-resistant, root-resistant, and leak proof. Another efficient method is pipe relining.
