<h3>Everything You Need To Know About A Blocked Drain in Whitehouse Station NJ</h3>

In addition, this approach entirely cleans up the inside of the drain or sewer line to keep the clog from returning. Our professionals will assess your drain issue and discuss the choices for drain cleaning and repair in Springfield.</p>
<p>If you're purchasing a brand-new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the huge bulk of toilets, the drain is focused about 12 in. from the wall. But with a few models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To check the rough-in, just determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't roughly 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. The majority of home centers carry just one or more 10-in. designs and no 14-in. models. Be prepared to spend much more if you have to special-order a toilet. If there's a door near the toilet, also determine how far the bowl extends from the wall. If you are replacing a toilet with a standard bowl with a lengthened" design, the door may not close.
