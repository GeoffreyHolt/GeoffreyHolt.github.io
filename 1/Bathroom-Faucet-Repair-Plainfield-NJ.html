And who wants to do all that work??? In all severity though, making sure your journey lever is working well can save you the inconvenience of those small everyday hassles - that many people just deal with and never ever realize they can fix in about 5 minutes - not to discuss the gallons of water wasted every day by a poor seal.</p>
