<h3>How To Stop Emergency Plumbing Water Damages Wellington CO</h3>
<p>Backflow implies the unfavorable reversal of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the drinkable supply of water; a backflow preventer is developed to keep this from taking place.

Such connections happen naturally in appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashers, but they should be carefully developed and installed to avoid backflow. Another typical location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the public water supply.</p>
