I in fact got their number for another company that could not come quickly enough but referred me to Price Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to examine and offer me a quote. They instantly cleared the preliminary clog, permitting the tenants to return from a hotel. Regrettably, upon further investigation, there was a considerable obstruction that required excavation to investigate. His group was on website the really next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 â² hole.
