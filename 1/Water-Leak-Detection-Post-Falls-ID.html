Also, the BPA needs to be set up according to the most recent plumbing code adopted by the City of Austin.</p>
<p>Discharge piping connected to a storm sewer will be geared up with backwater check valve. In commercial applications, for instance, AWWA M-14: Backflow Prevention and Cross-Connection Control Recommended Practices recommends a DCV assembly on dry or wet sprinkler systems unless there is a threat of a high-hazard cross-connection. In those cases, an RPZ assembly is recommended.</p>

Merely sharing a copy of your sewer line video with the city inspector can solve the problem. The technicians and plumbers at Jim Dandy Sewer and Plumbing can make a copy of your sewer scope video on a thumb drive so that you constantly have a copy for your insurance coverage company, real estate agent or city inspector.</p>
