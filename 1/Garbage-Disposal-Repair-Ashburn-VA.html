<p>CareSoft Elite ® is a top-of-the-line water softener, geared up with a high-performance resin that easily reduces the hardest of minerals. With a patented chlorine generator, our remarkable systems also supply an automatic cleaning cycle. The CARIX ® ion exchange process (CArbon Dioxide Regenerated Ion EXchanger) enables a purposeful partial desalination and therefore softening of drinking water including high quantities of hardeners, nitrate and sulfate.</p>
<p>Over time, the resin beads in the water softener will become covered with calcium and magnesium ions, diminishing their capacity to soften difficult water. Through a process called regrowth, water is immediately flushed through the water softener with a concentrated amount of regenerant. Now the resin beads get the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the hardness on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems include an entire house water filtration with its patented self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the dissolved rock and dirt and sediment are sent out down the drain. With the resin beads charged," the water softener goes back to service, offering the entire home with clean, soft water.</p>
