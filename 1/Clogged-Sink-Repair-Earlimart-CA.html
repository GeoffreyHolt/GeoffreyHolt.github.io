<p>The repair technician must have the ability to determine the lots of various producers and the specific designs produced throughout the years. Some models may seem similar on the outside but might require different repair parts on the inside, so the repair service technician should have the ability to identify the make, model and size of the backflow prevention assembly and any variations that might have been produced.
