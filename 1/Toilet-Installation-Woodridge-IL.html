This often causes a need for costly repairs, replacements, or additional maintenance services.</p>
<p>You might need to spend for the installation of electrical wiring if there is no grounded outlet present to power the garbage disposal. The cost of materials for a grounded outlet will likely cost in between $5 and $10, and $120 to $165 to employ an electrical contractor If your installation needs a brand-new switch, expect to spend an extra $5 to $10 on materials, and $50 for labor.</p>

<p>The Final Jeopardy answer, you ask? The device that regulates water circulation in your toilet. You'll see a supply line that runs from the outlet in the wall to the bottom of the toilet fill valve if you look behind your toilet. This is how water gets into your toilet. After you flush the toilet, the fill valve opens to fill up the water in the tank and the toilet bowl, preparing the system for the next flush. If your fill valve is broken, not set at the appropriate level, or isn't set up appropriately, you might experience a regularly or continuously "running" toilet - which can cost you hundreds of dollars in wasted water.</p>
