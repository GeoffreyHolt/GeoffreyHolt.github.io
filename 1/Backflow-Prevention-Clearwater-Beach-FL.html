<p>Sewer lines can stop working for a range of reasons, consisting of bad soil conditions, clogs from grease and grime, and deterioration. Even trees and bushes can cause problems for sewer lines, especially in older neighborhoods where clay pipe might have been used. In the cold Colorado winters, pipes can break from frozen ground, which can be two times as intensified if pipes have actually been permitted to freeze.</p>
<p>Responsibility for installation falls upon the owner of the co-op or the home or apartment board. Owners and boards of buildings that are issued an order by the DEP to install a backflow preventer should submit strategies with the DEP within thirty days. If the DEP has actually not received accreditation from a PE, RA, or LMP that the backflow preventer is at least in the process of being installed within that time, a Notice of Infraction will be sent out. Lawbreakers will be accountable for a civil penalty of up to $1,000 released by the Environmental protection Board (ECB). Continued non-compliance can ultimately cause civil and criminal actions and proceedings, as well as the termination of water service to the structure.</p>
