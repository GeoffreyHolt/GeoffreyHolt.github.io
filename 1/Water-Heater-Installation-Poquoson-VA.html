As structure types and contents of these structures can be very various, we need to comprehend that the fire protection system for any installation requires to be developed and installed to fulfill that specific hazard or need. An aircraft garage will need a very different fire defense system than the system required in an apartment building. The backflow defense requirements for these two examples would likewise vary significantly.</p>
