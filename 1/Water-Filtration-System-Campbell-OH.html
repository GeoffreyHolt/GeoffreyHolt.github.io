Dura PEX tends to have a great deal of oxidization. This causes cracks in the tubing that can lead to leakages. As these leaks take place, zinc is seeped from the fittings on the pipes, triggering them to degrade. Lastly, chlorinated water has been discovered to cause fractures in the clamps on these pipes. Repiping is the very best option to all of these problems.</p>
