<p>Backpressure is developed when pressure in a water supply surpasses the pressure in the drinkable system providing the cosmetics water. This can force the safe and clean water to reverse its direction of flow through the cross-connection between the 2 systems. Prospective contaminants can then get in the safe and clean water supply. The best method to lower build-up is have a professional flush it at least as soon as a year. In some locations of Virginia, where the water is particularly tough with high mineral content, you may need to flush the water heater regularly.</p>
<p>Call 831-393-9321 for quick and reliable water heater solutions. Experience true quality service when you deal with our Seaside plumbers.
