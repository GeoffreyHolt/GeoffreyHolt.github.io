<p>Maintenance is another consideration. While you can buy designs with unique features that do everything but include the salt, you will pay for each extra feature. The tradeoff will be cost for convenience and you have no longterm assurance that the unique feature will not fail. Depending on the water source, you may need to filter turbid water or disinfect bacteria-laden water-all before it even reaches the softening unit. Finally, if you own a septic tank, you should think about the extra load on your drainage field from backwashing and regrowth. Estimates show that about 50 gallons of water are utilized for each regrowth cycle. This may or may not cause hydraulic overload of the septic tank.</p>
<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is just half the formula! To just pour some media inside a tank and expect the best is typical in our market and numerous companies attempt to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Once again, years of experience and comprehensive testing led us to develop a tank that fluidizes the media bed much better than any other style on the market. Fluidization is the essential to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media transforms the solidity in the water to calcite crystals which will not adhere to anything even under extreme temperatures. It's just with the media and the fluidization properly interacting that you can attain this.</p>
