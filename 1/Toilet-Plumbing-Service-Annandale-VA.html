<p>Concealed water leakages are frequently difficult and have Potentially Serious Effects. Replacing your flapper might need somewhat different actions than we reveal (Pictures 2 and 3). Your flapper may screw onto a threaded rod or have a ring that slips over the overflow tube. Discovering a replacement flapper might be the hardest part of the job if you have an unusual flush valve. To find a suitable replacement, switch off the water, take the old one with you to the house center or hardware store. (Shut off the water before removing the flapper.) You may not find a similar match, but opportunities are you'll locate one of the same shape and size. If not, attempt a plumbing supply shop (in the Telephone Directory under Plumbing Supplies") or search online.</p>
