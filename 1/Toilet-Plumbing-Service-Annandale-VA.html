To find a suitable replacement, switch off the water, take the old one with you to the house center or hardware store. (Shut off the water before removing the flapper.) You may not find a similar match, but opportunities are you'll locate one of the same shape and size. If not, attempt a plumbing supply shop (in the Telephone Directory under Plumbing Supplies") or search online.</p>
