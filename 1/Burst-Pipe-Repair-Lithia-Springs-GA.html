Given that opposite charges bring in, the unfavorable charge of the minerals is drawn in to the positive charge of the resin beads. As the tough water travels through the resin, the beads get ahold of the mineral ions and remove them from the water. When the bead takes the mineral ion, the sodium ion is launched.
