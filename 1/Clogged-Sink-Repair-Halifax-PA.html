<p>We had a terrific experience with Joe Boyette, he was very professional, polite, proficient. We had a lot of plumbing repair after a fire for over a 2 month duration. We also needed to replace a water and a bathroom heater unrelated to the fire, however we felt confident in Joe's abilities. We decided to stay with Joe, even though we felt Mr Rooter costs were absolutely on the high-end. This being posted by Barbara Boyer from Atlanta.</p>

<p>Plumbing is the practice, materials and components utilized in the installation, maintenance, extension, and alteration of all piping, components, plumbing devices, and plumbing appurtenances in connection with sanitary drainage or storm drainage centers; venting systems and public or private supply of water systems, within or nearby to any building or structure.</p>
<p>To prep your system for installation, you might need to connect a cord with a plug to reach the outlet, or extension wires to reach a hardwired box In this case, I connected a cable with a plug set that I bought separately from the disposal unit. It's as basic as feeding the wires from the cord through the disposal and attaching them to the matching colors on the system with wire nuts.</p>
<p>If the work installed by the authorization holder is authorized by the inspector, the license holder if requested, will get a Certificate of Acceptance from the plumbing division. You can purchase a disposal that already has actually a cable connected if you're not comfy making electrical connections for your garbage disposal installation. Ask at your home center or device store, or search online for 'garbage disposal with cable attached.</p>
