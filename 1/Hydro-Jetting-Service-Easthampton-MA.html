<p>Renovation plumbers generally charge a minimum of $45 to $65 per hour for one male and a truck. Again, this does not include the cost of parts. But more and more plumbers are charging "by the fixture," and their quotes are based upon the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the components themselves (about $200).
