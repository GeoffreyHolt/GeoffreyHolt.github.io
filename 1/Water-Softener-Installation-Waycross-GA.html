<h3>How To Avoid A Drain Plumbing Emergency Waycross GA</h3>
<p>The most effective way to deal with tough water is with a water softener. Water is softened when calcium and magnesium-- the firmness ions-- are collected by small resin beads through a process called ion exchange. The resin beads are charged with salt or potassium ions. When hard water comes in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are taken out of the water and changed with sodium or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
