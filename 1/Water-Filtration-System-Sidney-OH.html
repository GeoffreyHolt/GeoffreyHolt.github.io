<h3>Signs That Your Water Heater Needs To Be Repaired Or Replaced in Sidney OH</h3>
<p>Button Plumbing was fantastic. If I shut off the water under the sink, they changed my kitchen faucet and included two new shut off valves under the sink which had always dripped in the past. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were extremely friendly and got the work done rapidly. The cost was quite affordable. I will definitely utilize them for any future plumbing needs. I was super pleased with their service.</p>
