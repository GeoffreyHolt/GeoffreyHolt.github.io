<p>A. The toilet fill valve measurements we show are determined from the inside bottom of the tank to the top of the fill valve. The threaded water system shank that fits through the bottom of the tank is not consisted of in this measurement. The addition of a backflow preventer reduces water service pressure to the building; additional, more considerable costs can happen if the drop in water pressure becomes a problem for homeowners. If installing a pump or larger size water service and backflow prevention device would combat the pressure loss, a PE or RA can assist identify.</p>
<p>Other signs you may need to repipe include rust in your supply of water, low water pressure, and damp spots in your walls, floor, or ceiling. While these are common indications that precede repiping services, they do not necessarily imply repiping is the only option. Contact our Brenham plumbers and we will have a look at the issue to determine the best strategy.</p>
