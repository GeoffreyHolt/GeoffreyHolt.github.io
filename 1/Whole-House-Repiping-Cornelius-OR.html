<h3>Looking For A Plumber In Cornelius OR</h3>
<p>Now wait a minute, some individuals say, doesn't the water pressure in the water supply keep the watering water from going backwards? Yes, most of the time it does. However, there are times when the water pressure drops in the supply system, and this is when the backflow happens. No, it is not a frequent event, but it does take place regularly than you believe! Typically it takes place at night when you do not discover the water was off for a few minutes. An example is when the public utility needs to shut off the water to repair a water pipe, or connect a new pipe. This makes building and construction projects quickly the most typical cause of backflow problems. Fire battling is another typical reason for backflow. Fire trucks use big pumps to suck the water out of the fire hydrants. This frequently causes the water pressure in the surrounding areas to drop, and backflow will take place in the surrounding communities.</p>
