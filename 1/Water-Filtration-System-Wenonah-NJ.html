<p>The majority of homes or structures that were constructed in the 1970s generally have galvanized piping. Over time, the plumbing system can wear out and the pipes can start to corrode. This can trigger low water pressure and affect the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping consists of iron pipes that have actually been coded with zinc to offer weather protection. As the external finishing of zinc starts to erode, the pipe is exposed to water and wetness, causing the iron to eventually rust.</p>
