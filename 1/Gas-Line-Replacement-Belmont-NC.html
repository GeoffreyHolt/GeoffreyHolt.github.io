<p>As the name recommends, a backflow preventer works to guarantee that liquids do not recede versus the required direction of flow. When used in the context of a fire sprinkler system, a backflow preventer device is utilized to ensure that water does not flow from the lawn sprinkler back into the municipal supply of water, or other source of drinking water. Sadly, water held in the sprinkler system can become contaminated. There is potential for the polluted water to become a health risk if permitted to re-enter the water supply. The backflow preventer is planned to avoid water flowing back towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be examined regularly for efficiency, in addition to checked yearly by a fire inspection company in order to ensure they are working as they should.</p>
