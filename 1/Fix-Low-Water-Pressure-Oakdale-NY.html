After we have actually cleaned up the body, and the repaired parts are still out of the body, and we have actually completed all of our part replacement and cleaning, we should open the inlet shut down to flush any rust or particles. This can be difficult, specifically when the backflow prevention assembly is installed inside an area where water can not be wallowed. It is very important that the inlet valve be opened to flush this dirt and debris even if some sort of water collection system needs to be used to ensure the line is effectively flushed.</p>
