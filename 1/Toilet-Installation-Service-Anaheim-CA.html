For inspection demands in the City of Westerville call (614) 901-6650 or the 24-hour inspection line at (614) 901-6880 before 12:00 p.m. for next day service.

<h3>Clearing Blocked Drains in Anaheim CA</h3>
<p>A malfunctioning waste disposal unit, grease buildup, built up food and more can all contribute to a clogged kitchen sink. The sink is the focal point in the kitchen and when you have a clogged kitchen sink, that will cause problems. There are a variety of methods homeowners can unclog a kitchen sink, including using a sink plunger, snaking the drain, or utilizing a solution of vinegar and baking soda. For the more extreme clogged kitchen sinks, call your local Roto-Rooter plumber.</p>
<p>Inadequately installed gas lines lead to gas leaks. Gas leaks are pricey to repair. Gas line installation is not a diy job. The gas lines have to be adjusted to the right levels by a certified professional. The US Department of Energy says that water heating can represent 14% -25% of the energy consumed in your house." It is the 2nd greatest energy consuming area of a house, next to heating and cooling. The quantity of minerals dissolved in water can trigger it to take longer for water to heat, increasing those energy expenses.</p>
<p>To prep your unit for installation, you may have to connect a cable with a plug to reach the outlet, or extension wires to reach a hardwired box In this case, I connected a cable with a plug package that I bought independently from the disposal unit. It's as easy as feeding the wires from the cord through the disposal and connecting them to the matching colors on the unit with wire nuts.</p>
<p>To get rid of the cord from the old disposer, utilize a screwdriver to eliminate the plate covering the electrical connections at the bottom of the unit. Detach the wire nuts and pull the cable through the cover plate hole. For preventive maintenance, Larry & Sons offers annual examinations on your sewer and septic systems. Our specialists carefully check your whole drainage system with video camera pipe inspection to avoid future problems before they take place. Our yearly maintenance services also include thorough drain cleaning to keep your pipes clear.</p>
