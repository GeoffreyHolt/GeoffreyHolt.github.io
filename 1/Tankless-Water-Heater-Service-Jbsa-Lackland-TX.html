Ensure your water heater is working appropriately with skilled hot water heater services by Epic Plumbing.

<p>A testable backflow prevention device has 2 check valves-- basically two layers of defense. The device allows water to press the check valves open when water is entering the building, however closes them shut when water tries to go the incorrect way. There are two different types of testable backflow prevention gadgets that are commonly defined-- a lowered pressure zone backflow device and a check backflow device. There are a few others that I will mention however do not get hung up on them. Because they will be on a certification test, I discuss them only.</p>
