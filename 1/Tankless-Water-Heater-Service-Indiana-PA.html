Throughout regeneration, salted water from the brine tank streams up the fill tube and into the softener tank. A rinse cycle commences and the salted water washes the mineral deposits off the resin beads. The regenerated water and the mineral deposits are flushed out the discharge hose. The system then reverts back to softening the incoming water.</p>
<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is only half the formula! To simply put some media inside a tank and wish for the very best is common in our market and lots of companies attempt to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Again, years of experience and comprehensive testing led us to create a tank that fluidizes the media bed much better than any other style on the marketplace. Fluidization is the key to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media converts the hardness in the water to calcite crystals which will not stick to anything even under extreme temperatures. It's just with the media and the fluidization properly interacting that you can achieve this.</p>
