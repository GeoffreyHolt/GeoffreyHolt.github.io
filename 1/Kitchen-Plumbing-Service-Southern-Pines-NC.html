<p>Concealed water leaks are often stressful and have Possibly Severe Consequences. Replacing your flapper might require somewhat different actions than we reveal (Photos 2 and 3). Your flapper may screw onto a threaded rod or have a ring that slips over the overflow tube. Discovering a replacement flapper may be the hardest part of the job if you have an uncommon flush valve. To find a suitable replacement, turn off the water, take the old one with you to the house center or hardware shop. (Shut off the water before eliminating the flapper.) You might not discover a similar match, however opportunities are you'll locate one of the same shape and size. If not, try a plumbing supply store (in the Telephone Directory under Plumbing Supplies") or search online.</p>

<p>IRWD is devoted to delivering safe, high quality water to clients. Our substantial water quality program runs 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, to make sure that the water provided to our consumers is kept devoid of damaging contaminants. An important part of our water quality program is the backflow prevention program When a water line is connected to equipment consisting of a nonpotable substance, this is referred to as a cross-connection. Contamination may occur when water streams through a cross-connection from a nonpotable source, such as a lawn sprinkler or heating & cooling system, into the drinkable water supply. This can take place through a process called backflow.</p>
<p>Wood pipes were used in London and elsewhere during the 16th and 17th centuries. The pipes were hollowed-out logs which were tapered at the end with a little hole in which the water would pass through. 21 The several pipes were then sealed together with hot animal fat. Wood pipes were used in Philadelphia, 22 Boston, and Montreal in the 1800s. Built-up wood tubes were commonly utilized in the USA during the 20th century. These pipes (used in location of corrugated iron or strengthened concrete pipes) were made from areas cut from brief lengths of wood. Locking of adjacent rings with wood dowel pins produced a flexible structure. About 100,000 feet of these wood pipes were set up during WW2 in drainage culverts, storm sewers and avenues, under highways and at army camps, marine stations, airfields and ordnance plants.</p>
