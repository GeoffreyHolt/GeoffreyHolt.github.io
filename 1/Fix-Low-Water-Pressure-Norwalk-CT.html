<p>As the water treatment industry has actually grown in the U.S., the idea of water softening has actually often been misunderstood as a purifying, cleaning or conditioning procedure. This is due largely to exaggerated advertising and, in part, to consumer mistaken beliefs about water treatment. But the truth is that water softening merely gets rid of hardness minerals and gets rid of problems that are an annoyance and not a hazard to human health. The choice "to soften or not to soften" is a matter of personal choice not necessity. Nevertheless, water softening does have benefits, and disadvantages, that make this choice a substantial one.</p>

Given that a water heater is a point of lots of leakages in the home, this will give you peace of mind and guarantee that your family has a continuous supply of warm water.
