Through a process called regeneration, water is immediately flushed through the water softener with a focused amount of regenerant.

WaterBoss water softener systems feature a whole house water filtration with its patented self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the dissolved rock and dirt and sediment are sent out down the drain. With the resin beads recharged," the water softener goes back to service, offering the whole house with clean, soft water.</p>
