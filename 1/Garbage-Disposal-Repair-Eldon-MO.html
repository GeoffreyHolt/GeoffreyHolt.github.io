<p>Won't drain - The system might not be slicing food effectively and waste might have clogged the drain pipe. Nevertheless, if there are numerous leakages within the system, or if there is proof of corrosion in a number of locations, it is probably time to repipe. A water softener is packed with resin beads. Difficult water with calcium and magnesium flows through this resin and, in a process called ion exchange, the hardness ions in the water trade locations with soft ions on the resin beads. The outcome is soft water.</p>

Before entering into how to repair a toilet, it would benefit to understand how a toilet works.  Many homes in the United States, including Tampa Bay Area, have what is described as a Flush Toilet.  Toilets also have a flapper seal made of rubber at the bottom of the cistern that keeps the water in the tank till the toilet is flushed.  This seal weakens with time permitting water to leave into the toilet bowl, thus decreasing the amount of water in the tank offered for a flush.  It also has the downside of increasing your water bill due to wastage of water.</p>

<p>As the water treatment market has grown in the U.S., the idea of water softening has typically been misinterpreted as a purifying, cleansing or conditioning procedure. This is due mostly to exaggerated marketing and, in part, to consumer misconceptions about water treatment. However the reality is that water softening simply removes hardness minerals and gets rid of problems that are a nuisance and not a danger to human health. The decision "to soften or not to soften" is a matter of individual choice not need. Nevertheless, water softening does have benefits, and downsides, that make this decision a substantial one.</p>
