For these reasons, your water district need to take safety measures to secure its public water supply versus backflow.</p>
<p>With time, the resin beads in the water softener will end up being covered with calcium and magnesium ions, diminishing their capacity to soften tough water.

Now the resin beads pick up the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the solidity on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems include an entire house water filtration with its patented self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the dissolved rock and dirt and sediment are sent out down the drain. With the resin beads charged," the water softener goes back to service, offering the whole house with clean, soft water.</p>
