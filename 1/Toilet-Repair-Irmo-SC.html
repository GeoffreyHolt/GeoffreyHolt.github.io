<p>Backpressure may take place when the drinkable supply piping is connected to a system or fixture which exceeds the operating pressure of the supply piping. Higher pressure can be brought on by booster pumps, boilers, pressure vessels, or raised piping in places such as high-rise buildings or tanks. Drinkable and non-potable water or liquids can be required into the safe and clean supply system if these connections are not correctly secured.</p>
<p>In many cases, an absence of hot water is brought on by a malfunctioning circuit breaker or a broken high-temperature cutoff switch. The dip tube inside the tank may be broken if the water is lukewarm. Scalding water is usually the outcome of a broken pressure relief valve or a bad thermostat. In either case, scalding water threatens and must be instantly addressed by a skilled plumbing professional.</p>
