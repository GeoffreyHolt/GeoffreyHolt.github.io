<p>Most of the times, an absence of hot water is caused by a defective circuit breaker or a broken high-temperature cutoff switch. If the water is lukewarm, the dip tube inside the tank may be split.

In either case, scalding water is dangerous and should be immediately resolved by a skilled plumbing professional.</p>
