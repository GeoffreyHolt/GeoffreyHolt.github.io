There are a lot of kinds of piping systems and conditions, it's a good concept to get a whole home plumbing inspection in addition to a hot water heater and sewer camera inspection.</p>
<p>Have steel or iron piping and notification rust-colored water coming from your water appliances? This is a good sign that your pipes may be rusting from the inside and for that reason, need to be replaced.
