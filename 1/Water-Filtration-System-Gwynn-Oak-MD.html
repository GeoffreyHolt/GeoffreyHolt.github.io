<p>Pre-action sprinkler systems typically are set up in locations where water might trigger catastrophic damage, such as in freezers, computer spaces, and locations with electronic equipment. The piping in a pre-action system contains air or nitrogen, which can be pressurized or non-pressurized. Water to the system is held back by the pre-action valve, which is connected to a fire detection system. If a fire happens, the detection system sends a signal that opens the pre-action valve, which then permits water into the system's piping. The water is released through the open sprinkler.</p>

<p>Seattle Public Utilities needs that any cross connection have a backflow preventer. The backflow preventer may be required to be located on the water service line, within the structure, or both areas. After an initial inspection and testing of a recently set up backflow preventer, the water consumer is needed to have the backflow preventer evaluated on an annual basis.</p>
<p>For RPZ devices, drainage capability will be sized to accommodate both intermittent discharges and a devastating failure of the relief valve. Describe manufacturers flow curves to figure out optimal discharge rate based upon supply pressure or on-site pressure; whichever is greater.
