Fire defense system are designed to match the risk that exists in the areas they are set up in. As structure types and contents of these buildings can be very various, we need to understand that the fire protection system for any installation needs to be developed and set up to meet that particular risk or need. An aircraft garage will need a really various fire security system than the system needed in an apartment building. The backflow security requirements for these 2 examples would also vary significantly.</p>
