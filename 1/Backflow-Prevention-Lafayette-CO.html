<h3>Helpful Tips For Choosing The Right Plumbing Service Lafayette CO</h3>

The GFAVB is a non-testable system and are good for back siphonage just for non-health hazard or health threat conditions. They need to be set up downstream from any shut down valves and can not be under pressure for more than 12 hours. If an GFAVB is utilized backflow prevention on a watering system you must install one GFAVB after every valve for each zone in the system.  It needs to also be installed a minimum of 6 inches (150 mm) higher than the highest outlet in the system (some GFAVB manufacturers, and some local authorities, require that they be set up 12 inches (300 mm) higher than the greatest outlet). Some municipalities do not permit the use of GFAVB's. These units will NOT prevent backflow pressure and can just protect against back siphonage.</p>
