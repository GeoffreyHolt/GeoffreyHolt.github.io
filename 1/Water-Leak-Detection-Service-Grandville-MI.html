<p>The primary media contained within a water softener is known as ion exchange resin. This resin is essentially an insoluble matrix normally in the shape of small (1-2 mm diameter) beads. The product has highly developed structure of pores on the surface of which are sites with quickly caught and released ions. This procedure of trapping of ions occurs with a synchronised launching of other ions resulting in the term ion-exchange. Ion exchange resins can be produced to selectively choose one, or possibly several different kinds of ions. Typically, these resins are based on cross-linked polystyrene.</p>
<p>When lime is contributed to the water, it changes the water chemistry, causing the calcium to come out of the option.
