Points at which a safe and clean water supply connects with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections.

Another typical area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public supply of water.</p>
