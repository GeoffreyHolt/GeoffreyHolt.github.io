<p>Backpressure backflow is caused by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's drinkable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the potable supply of water pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the potable supply of water pressure, or a mix of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be developed by pumps, temperature level increases in boilers, etc. Reductions in safe and clean supply of water pressure take place whenever the quantity of water being used goes beyond the amount of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
