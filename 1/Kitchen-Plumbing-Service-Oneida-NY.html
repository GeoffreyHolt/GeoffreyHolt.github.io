<p>A backflow preventer is a way or system to avoid backflow. The standard means of preventing backflow is an air space, which either eliminates a cross-connection or supplies a barrier to backflow. The standard system for avoiding backflow is a mechanical backflow preventer, which offers a physical barrier to backflow. The principal types of mechanical backflow preventer are the reduced-pressure principle assembly, the pressure vacuum breaker assembly, and the check valve assembly. A secondary kind of mechanical backflow preventer is the residential dual check valve.</p>
<p>Single flush High Effectiveness Toilets (HETs) use 1.28 gallons per flush. The latest dual flush HET used by Bonney will use approximately 1.1 gallons per flush.

Proper care and waste disposal unit maintenance will keep it running long past its warranty and keep your drain lines clear.</p>
