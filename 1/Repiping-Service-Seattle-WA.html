<p>The primary media consisted of within a water softener is called ion exchange resin. This resin is generally an insoluble matrix generally in the shape of small (1-2 mm size) beads. The product has highly established structure of pores on the surface area of which are websites with easily caught and released ions. This procedure of trapping of ions happens with a simultaneous launching of other ions leading to the term ion-exchange. Ion exchange resins can be manufactured to selectively choose one, or possibly numerous different kinds of ions. Typically, these resins are based upon cross-linked polystyrene.</p>
<p>Water softeners resolve a process called ion exchange which removes calcium and magnesium from the water. When the hard water enters into the mineral tank, it flows through a bed of spherical resin beads These plastic beads, normally made from polystyrene, are charged with a salt ion. The resin beads are anions, meaning they have an unfavorable charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a positive charge, making them cations. Since opposite charges draw in, the negative charge of the minerals is drawn in to the favorable charge of the resin beads. As the hard water travels through the resin, the beads get ahold of the mineral ions and remove them from the water. When the bead seizes the mineral ion, the sodium ion is released. The column of resin strips all the solidity out of the water as it goes through the mineral tank, and softened water drains into your home.</p>
