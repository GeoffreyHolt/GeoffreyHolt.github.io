We may hear the hot water heater making sounds, trying to inform us there is a problem, however we ignore it which may lead to a more substantial repair that if we would have nipped it in the bud. It is very important to get out in front of any problems as fast as possible. The quicker you respond to a concern, the better chance you'll need to save time and money on water heater services.</p>
