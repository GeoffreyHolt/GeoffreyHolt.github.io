When turned on, your disposal system pulls down wastewater and any material debris by centrifugal force. However it does not shred such debris. Instead, it grinds it into a paste at high speed so that it can quickly flow into the drain pipe along with the rest of your wastewater.</p>

The heating temperature level is usually pre-set to match your preferences and requirements.
