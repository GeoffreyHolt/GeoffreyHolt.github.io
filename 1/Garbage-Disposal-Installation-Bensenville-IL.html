Unlike a drip leg, the circulation of the gas is altered to eliminate any sediment. A sediment trap might be consisted of in a drip leg install. The City requires backflow prevention gadgets to be installed anywhere there exists a connection that could permit tainted water into the City system or personal plumbing. These devices go through testing by a qualified backflow prevention assembly tester upon installation. In many cases, they undergo periodic tests later, as well.</p>
