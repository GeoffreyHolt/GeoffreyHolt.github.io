<p>New England Pipe Restoration is the premier sewer repair service provider in the Northeast. While this might appear like a problem with your faucet, it's generally caused by something else - like a plumbing issue or issue with your water heater. More and more individuals are selling their old water heaters for new, tankless variations. Whether you're seeking to increase your home's eco-friendliness or just plain tired of running out of hot water, a tankless water heater might be the ideal solution for you.</p>
<p>You want to save water. Older toilets use up to seven gallons of water per flush and are much less water-efficient than more recent designs. U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's WaterSense toilets utilize less than 1.6 gallons per flush. Replacing your toilet with a brand-new model can save countless gallons of water - minimizing your energy bills and assisting the environment.</p>
