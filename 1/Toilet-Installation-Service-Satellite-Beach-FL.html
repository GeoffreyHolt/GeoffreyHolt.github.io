Based upon research conducted by the Water Quality Association (WQA) Water Softener Advantages Study, 2011.</p>
<p>Many softeners have actually a bypass developed into the outlet and the inlet. By turning a valve, you can bypass the softener in the event you have to offer some sort of maintenance to it or even while you're working on installing it.

<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is only half the formula! To simply pour some media inside a tank and expect the best is typical in our industry and numerous companies try to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Once again, years of experience and thorough testing led us to develop a tank that fluidizes the media bed better than any other style on the market. Fluidization is the key to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media converts the hardness in the water to calcite crystals which will not stick to anything even under severe temperatures. It's just with the media and the fluidization effectively collaborating that you can achieve this.</p>
