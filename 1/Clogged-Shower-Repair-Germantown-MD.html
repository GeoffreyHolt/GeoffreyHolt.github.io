<p>To prep your system for installation, you might need to connect a cord with a plug to reach the outlet, or extension wires to reach a hardwired box In this case, I connected a cable with a plug set that I purchased separately from the disposal system. It's as simple as feeding the wires from the cable through the disposal and attaching them to the matching colors on the unit with wire nuts.</p>
<p>Call 831-393-9321 for quick and reliable water heater solutions. Experience true quality service when you work with our Seaside plumbers. If your disposal is clogged, do not utilize severe drain cleaning chemicals to attempt to unclog the system. Chemicals can damage the mechanical parts, shortening the life of the disposal. Just a plumber with experience in repiping can tell you that you need new pipes. Nevertheless, there are some indications that you may need pipe repair services-- or a total pipe replacement. While other things may be to blame, call a plumbing company instantly if you notice any of the following concerns.</p>
