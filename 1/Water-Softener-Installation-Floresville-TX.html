This is due mainly to exaggerated marketing and, in part, to consumer mistaken beliefs about water treatment. However the truth is that water softening simply gets rid of firmness minerals and removes problems that are a nuisance and not a danger to human health. The decision "to soften or not to soften" is a matter of individual choice not requirement. Nevertheless, water softening does have advantages, and downsides, that make this decision a substantial one.</p>
<p>After showing up after their window, they began to examine the kitchen sink (and after one of the two gentlemen tossed up outdoors), they ran a snake down the sink and after that put the sink back together but declared they would not take duty if it dripped now due to the fact that of some unspecified curiosity in how my sink was created. After they provided me the "don't pour grease down the sink" lecture and they left, I discovered they handled to reassemble the sink in such a manner in which the sprayer hose was twisted around the plumbing. I didn't even bother to attempt calling them back, since I never want to see this company once again.</p>
