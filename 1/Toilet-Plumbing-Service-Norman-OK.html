<p>If you're buying a new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the large bulk of toilets, the waste pipe is focused about 12 in. from the wall.

If you need to special-order a toilet, be prepared to invest far more. Likewise determine how far the bowl protrudes from the wall if there's a door near the toilet.
