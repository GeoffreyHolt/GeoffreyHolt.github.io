<p>If you experience blockages and backups in your house more than a couple of times, it's an excellent idea to have a professional examine your drain system. A drain specialist like TLC will utilize a camera to inspect your drain system.

The camera can locate and recognize the problem so the drain can be repaired.</p>
<p>A backflow preventer is a way or mechanism to avoid backflow. The basic means of avoiding backflow is an air gap, which either gets rid of a cross-connection or offers a barrier to backflow. The standard mechanism for preventing backflow is a mechanical backflow preventer, which provides a physical barrier to backflow. The principal kinds of mechanical backflow preventer are the reduced-pressure principle assembly, the pressure vacuum breaker assembly, and the double check valve assembly. A secondary type of mechanical backflow preventer is the residential dual check valve.</p>
<p>Other indications you might need to repipe consist of rust in your water supply, low water pressure, and damp areas in your walls, floor, or ceiling. While these prevail indications that precede repiping services, they do not necessarily mean repiping is the only service.
