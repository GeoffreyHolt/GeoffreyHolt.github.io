<p>Softeners mainly eliminate calcium (Ca2+) and magnesium (Mg2+) ions. Calcium and magnesium are typically referred to as 'firmness minerals'. In addition, if your pipes are rattling, clanging, clacking and making more noise than they should be (more than water streaming through the pipes), that's a substantial warning that something more severe is wrong with them.</p>
<p>Eventually, nevertheless, the beads reach optimal capacity and can't attract anymore mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank need to be regrowed, or, flushed clean. That's where the brine tank comes in. An on-board computer system calculates the quantity of water that streams through the softener. When it reaches the preprogrammed setting, regeneration automatically starts. For a three-bedroom house and household of four, regrowth normally takes place every 12,000 gallons.</p>
