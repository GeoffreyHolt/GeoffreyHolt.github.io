<h3>Jenkintown PA Experts In Unclogging Drains</h3>
<p>In water distribution systems, water is generally preserved at a substantial pressure to allow water to flow from the tap, shower, or other fixture. Water pressure may fail or be decreased when a water pipe bursts, pipes freeze, or there is unexpectedly high need on the water system (for example, when a number of fire hydrants are opened). Decreased pressure in the pipe may permit contaminated water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be prepared into the system.</p>
<p>Every day, the drains in your home effectively get rid of big amounts of water and waste. Over time, dirt, debris, hair, and countless other little particles can get trapped and develop in your pipes. Ultimately, the water might not be able to drain quickly or efficiently, and you might experience water pooling in your bathroom sink or a toilet that is constantly backing up. It may be time to call on a professional from Atlas Plumbing to examine when this occurs.</p>
