<p>A pressure vacuum breaker (PVB) is thought about a testable backflow preventer, but it is also very uncommon. They were manufactured so as to offer the plumber a testable vacuum breaker device. When it comes to the threat, this device covers hazardous as well as non-hazardous situations. However simply as with the AVB it can not handle back pressure, only back siphonage.</p>
<p>Repiping is not a short-term fix. It's an irreversible service for the whole plumbing system in your house or company.
