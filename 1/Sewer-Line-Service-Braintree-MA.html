<p>Identifying if you need a water softener is a personal choice. A permit is not needed for repairs which include just the working parts of a faucet or valve or clearance of interruptions offered changes are not made in the existing piping or components. A common water softener consists of a tall, narrow water-softener tank, and a short, large brine tank. The softener tank is connected to the home's water-supply line. A small-diameter fill tube links the brine tank to the softener tank. And a discharge hose runs from the softener tank to a neighboring drain or drywell.</p>

Due to the reality that water conditioners use a physical media instead of a chemical media, they are often thought about a greener option in locations where it is prohibited to utilize salt. Water conditioners do not efficiently remove solidity from the water supply, however, as the only method to do this is with a salt-based media.</p>
