<h3>Need A Plumber Service Millis MA</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Instead of a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has actually been sized to manage peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively adjust to your company' circulation rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high circulation demand, tanks come online to add flow rate capacity. During durations of low flow demand, tanks go off-line. This new technique to softening is called responsive or progressive flow innovation, and it's perhaps the most important development in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
