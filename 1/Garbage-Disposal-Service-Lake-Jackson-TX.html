<p>Water softeners resolve a process called ion exchange which removes calcium and magnesium from the water. When the tough water participates in the mineral tank, it flows through a bed of spherical resin beads These plastic beads, normally made from polystyrene, are charged with a sodium ion.

Given that opposite charges bring in, the unfavorable charge of the minerals is attracted to the favorable charge of the resin beads.

<p>Water heater repair and hot water heater installation are typically put off as long as possible. A hot water heater is an expensive plumbing device, and we tend to press off changing it until it breaks beyond repair. It is also a piece of plumbing devices that we forget about up until we wake up to a cold shower. We may hear the water heater making sounds, trying to inform us there is a problem, however we ignore it which might cause a more substantial repair that if we would have nipped it in the bud. It's important to get out in front of any problems as fast as possible. The quicker you respond to a problem, the much better possibility you'll need to conserve money and time on water heater services.</p>
