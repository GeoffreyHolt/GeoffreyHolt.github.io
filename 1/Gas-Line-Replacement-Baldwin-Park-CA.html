Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the drinkable water system pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the potable water system pressure, or a mix of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature level increases in boilers, and so on. Decreases in potable supply of water pressure occur whenever the amount of water being utilized exceeds the quantity of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
