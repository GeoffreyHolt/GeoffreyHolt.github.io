<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is only half the formula! To just pour some media inside a tank and expect the very best is typical in our market and many companies attempt to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Once again, years of experience and comprehensive testing led us to develop a tank that fluidizes the media bed much better than any other style on the marketplace. Fluidization is the key to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media transforms the hardness in the water to calcite crystals which will not adhere to anything even under extreme temperatures. It's only with the media and the fluidization properly collaborating that you can accomplish this.</p>
