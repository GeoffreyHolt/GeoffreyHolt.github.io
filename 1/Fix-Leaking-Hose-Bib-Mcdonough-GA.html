<p>She knew about the service call cost. The 4 In Your Corner Investigation found that's a typical cost. Consumer Investigator Jodi Brooks called around to try to get a price quote from personal plumbers for a waste disposal unit replacement. None of the businesses we called would provide a quote over the phone. All of them wanted to take a look at the scenario prior to dedicating to a price, and all wanted to charge a service charge to come out. Brooks found just one plumber who would come out without charging.</p>
