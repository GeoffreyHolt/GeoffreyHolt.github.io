<p>Another disadvantage of water softening through ion exchange is the possible health risk for individuals on low sodium diet plans. Ion exchange increases the amount of salt in water, in order to lower its mineral material. Usually, this process adds 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending on how difficult the water was to begin with. Harder water will result in more salt, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For most people, this increase in sodium is small, however if you have actually been advised by a physician to follow a stringent low sodium diet plan this increase can posture problems.</p>
