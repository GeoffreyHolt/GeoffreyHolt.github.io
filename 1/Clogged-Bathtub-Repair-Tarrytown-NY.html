<p>A water softener is a whole-house filtration system that gets rid of hardness-causing calcium and magnesium minerals from your water through a procedure called ion exchange.  A water softener addresses one of the most common and disastrous water problems: difficult water.  Tough water wreaks havoc on the contemporary house. Scale builds up in your pipes, clogging them and reducing water pressure.  Scale drastically shortens the life-span of home appliances like dishwashers, coffee machine and ice devices. Hard water destroys hot water appliances. The greater the temperature level of the water, the more calcium and magnesium will solidify and harden into solid deposits inside your warm water heater.</p>
