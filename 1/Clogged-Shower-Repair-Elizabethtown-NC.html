<h3>The Importance Of Commercial Plumbing Services Elizabethtown NC</h3>
<p>PEX pipes were thought to be a much better alternative to galvanized and polybutylene piping. Unfortunately, one brand is experiencing a great deal of problems: Dura PEX. Dura PEX tends to have a lot of oxidization. This causes cracks in the tubing that can result in leakages. As these leakages occur, zinc is leached from the fittings on the pipes, triggering them to deteriorate. Lastly, chlorinated water has been found to cause fractures in the clamps on these pipes. Repiping is the very best service to all of these issues.</p>
