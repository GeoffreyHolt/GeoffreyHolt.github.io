<p>Sewer backups can be reported to (503) 823-1700. A reaction team is offered for initial investigation of sewer emergency situations every day of the year. Call the City's sewer and drainage maintenance personnel at (503) 823-1700 if sewage from the City-maintained part of the sewer system backs up through sinks or toilets. City employees will check and get rid of clogs in the mainline sewer and the portion of the service line that the City is accountable for. If the problem is the result of excessive storm water in the system, you may need to wait till the storm has actually decreased to have the backup fixed.</p>
<p>If you're buying a new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the vast bulk of toilets, the waste pipe is centered about 12 in. from the wall. But with a couple of designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To examine the rough-in, just measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't approximately 12 in.. Many house centers bring only one or two 10-in. models and no 14-in. models. Be prepared to spend much more if you have to special-order a toilet. Also measure how far the bowl extends from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are replacing a toilet with a basic bowl with an extended" model, the door might not close. Continue reading to learn how to install a toilet.</p>
