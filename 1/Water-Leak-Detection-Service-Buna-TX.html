<h3>How To Stop Emergency Plumbing Water Damages Buna TX</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Instead of a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to handle peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to effectively adapt to your business' circulation rates throughout the day. During periods of high flow need, tanks come online to add circulation rate capability. During periods of low circulation need, tanks go off-line. This new approach to softening is called progressive or responsive flow innovation, and it's arguably the most important innovation in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
