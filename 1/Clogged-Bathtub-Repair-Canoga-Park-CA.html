<p>The usual service is to have the malfunctioning pipes replaced when you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes. Nevertheless, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes replaced, which is where whole-house repiping is available in.

Steel was the most popular choice for house plumbing for many decades, but steel ultimately suffers from corrosion and does not have the toughness of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
