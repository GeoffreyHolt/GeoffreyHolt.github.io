<h3>Quality Plumbing Services In Monongahela PA</h3>
<p>So now that you understand you have a backup in your main line, how do you clear it? Unfortunately, main line obstructions are not something a house owner can fix. This kind of clog needs a professional plumber or drain specialist to utilize a drain cleaning machine to locate the clog and get it cleared. TLC can make use of a camera to see down into the drain line and find the clog or break in the line. All TLC's Drain Cleaning Professionals are equipped with this type of camera to identify and repair the drain issue. This type of camera is specifically useful in finding an issue if you have a long sewer line from your home to the sewer system or septic tank.</p>
<p>Water softeners overcome a procedure called ion exchange which removes calcium and magnesium from the water. When the tough water participates in the mineral tank, it flows through a bed of spherical resin beads These plastic beads, normally made from polystyrene, are charged with a salt ion. The resin beads are anions, implying they have an unfavorable charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a favorable charge, making them cations. Since opposite charges draw in, the negative charge of the minerals is drawn in to the positive charge of the resin beads. As the hard water goes through the resin, the beads grab ahold of the mineral ions and eliminate them from the water. When the bead seizes the mineral ion, the salt ion is released. The column of resin strips all the solidity out of the water as it passes through the mineral tank, and softened water flows out into your home.</p>
