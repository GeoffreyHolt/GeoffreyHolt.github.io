<p>Aside from these two important elements, there are a myriad of small, perhaps less crucial things that can break or weaken. For example, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will corrode far more quickly. Constant gross smells coming from the toilet can indicate you need a brand-new wax ring where your toilet attaches to the floor drain. You might need a brand-new cap for the fill valve if the float rod of your fill valve isn't raising properly. Bulges in the supply line can burst and trigger a leak. If mishandled, tank covers can split and leave your toilet's inner operations exposed. While this will not impact the function of your toilet, it definitely does not do much for the aesthetic of your bathroom. We're not attempting to psych you out by pointing out all the things that can go wrong, the point is - your toilet is a total component and every part needs to be in excellent shape for it to function at its best.</p>
