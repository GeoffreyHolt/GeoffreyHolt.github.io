Lots of insurance companies will not cover a slow leak. Claims may be rejected because the standard HO-3 property owners' policy specifically omits "a loss as the result of a water leak over a prolonged period of time." Call your insurance agent and verify your coverage. Double check with your representative to confirm that your understanding is appropriate as soon as you have checked out through your policy and validated what is covered and what is not covered.</p>
<p>Because the copper pipes have actually not had a possibility to end up being layered inside, New homes developed with copper pipes are especially vulnerable to destructive water conditions. As advised by the MDH, it is best NOT to soften the water in a brand-new house for a duration of three to five months after occupancy. This can be done by merely bypassing the water softener's filter medium. See your owner's handbook for instructions on bypassing your softener. Lots of new houses are built with PEX and not copper.</p>
