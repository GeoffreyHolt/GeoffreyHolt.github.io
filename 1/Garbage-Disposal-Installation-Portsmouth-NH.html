<p>If you need a water softener is a personal preference, identifying. A license is not required for repairs which include only the working parts of a faucet or valve or clearance of stoppages provided changes are not made in the existing piping or fixtures. A common water softener consists of a tall, narrow water-softener tank, and a brief, broad salt water tank. The softener tank is connected to the house's water-supply line. A small-diameter fill tube connects the salt water tank to the softener tank. And a discharge hose ranges from the softener tank to a neighboring drainpipe or drywell.</p>
<p>Physical Damage: Water tank and water heater repair from physical damage such as cracks or leakages are also typical occurrences.
