In order to repipe your home, Cabrillo will need to remove little sections of your drywall so we can access and replace your pipes. Depending upon the size of your home, this procedure will likely take a few days to a week to finish.

<p>Water softening describes the removal of magnesium, calcium, and other minerals from water. The most popular approach of water softening is through a process called ion exchange. During ion exchange, mineral ions are traded for another kind of ion-- generally salt. The result is water that's been successfully softened by removing nearly all traces of the minerals that constitute tough water.</p>

<p>Cold showers? High energy bills? It might be time for a brand-new warm water heater. However in order to reap the benefits of a new energy-efficient home appliance, you'll need to have it installed correctly. A hot water heater that is not installed properly can result in water damage, scalding temperatures, or perhaps a fire. That's why installation is best left to professional plumbers who know the ins and outs of your plumbing system.</p>
<p>Though it's not constantly required, often the plumber might need to upgrade or repair wiring to power the new waste disposal unit. This normally costs an additional $50 to $100+. The pilot light may need to be relit, the gas line may be clogged or need repair. The flowers or greenery near the gas leak will be discolored or deteriorated if the gas line is damaged. Contact our professionals to figure out the extent of the problem.</p>

While the minerals will not hurt your health, they can leave insoluble mineral deposits, making the water unsuitable-- and quite a nuisance-- for its numerous designated uses around your home.</p>
