<p>Atmospheric vacuum breakers (AVB) are the easiest design of backflow preventer. If you have less than 6 control valves, they are the least costly, but also the least reliable choice.

Sprinkler Storage facility does not recommend AVB's for waterings systems where there is a possible to contaminate drinking water. When one has actually failed, avb's are not testable and it is not possible to identify.</p>

Softeners with a timer flush and recharge on the basis of a fixed schedule-- say, 11 p.m. every 3 days, no matter whether the water really needs it. More recent systems utilize electronic sensing units that keep track of bead depletion and other essential metrics based on your water use and for that reason just regrow when required. These more recent systems, also described as demand-initiated regeneration softeners, are perfect since they save energy and money-- utilizing less water and salt for regrowth.</p>
