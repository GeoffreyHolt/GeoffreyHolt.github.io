<p>The repair technician need to have the ability to identify the many various manufacturers and the specific designs produced for many years. Some models might appear similar on the outdoors but might require various repair parts on the inside, so the repair technician must have the ability to identify the make, design and size of the backflow prevention assembly and any variations that may have been produced. Often the identification number of the assembly will be needed to differentiate one model from another. It is very important to understand the appropriate design to assure you get the appropriate repair parts.</p>

<p>When a flush valve causes a toilet to run, a worn flapper is usually the perpetrator. But not always. First, take a look at the chain that raises the flapper. It can tangle up and prevent the flapper from closing securely if there's too much slack in the chain. A chain with too little slack can trigger difficulty too. Picture 3 shows how to set the slack perfect.</p>
