<p>Clogged toilet? Leaking toilet tank? Need some repairs? Our group here at 1-800-anytyme can assist. We understand that clogged toilets and other toilet concerns are the extremely epitome of hassle, which is why you want them to work effectively and have issues looked after them as quickly as they arise.

Most of the time, copper pipes replace the main water and waste lines, and various kinds of plastic pipes will branch off from the copper lines to the components and fit into smaller spaces.</p>
<p>When a flush valve causes a toilet to run, a used flapper is normally the culprit. However not constantly. Initially, look at the chain that raises the flapper. If there's too much slack in the chain, it can tangle up and prevent the flapper from closing strongly. A chain with too little slack can cause problem too. Picture 3 demonstrates how to set the slack just right.</p>
