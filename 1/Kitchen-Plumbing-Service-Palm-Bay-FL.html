<p>I had a major sewer concern with a 1940s house, with rainwater and sewage was supporting into the basement shower. I began calling any number I might discover on Google. I really got their number for another company that could not come quickly enough but referred me to Cost Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to investigate and offer me a quote. They right away cleared the preliminary blockage, permitting the occupants to return from a hotel. Regrettably, upon more examination, there was a significant blockage that needed excavation to examine. His team was on site the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this initial concern and setting up a protective liner, it was figured out that there was yet another break existed. This took place yet a 3rd time as they worked their method through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
