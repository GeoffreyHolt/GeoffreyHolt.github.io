<h3>24 Hour Emergency Plumbing Helena AL</h3>

Sometimes during the sandblasting the sandblasting will use thin and blow through the wall of pipes and joints.

<h3>Faucet Problems That Need Faucet Replacement in Helena AL</h3>
<p>This is a bad indication. Toilets must absolutely never wobble, move, or wiggle. It's not you, and it's not something you're doing. That toilet should be replaced if you can move a toilet around by doing anything less intense than swinging a sledgehammer at it. Incorrectly seated and sealed toilets might leak, damage plumbing, or perhaps jeopardize the structural stability of the house.</p>
<p>If you're buying a brand-new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the large majority of toilets, the waste pipe is centered about 12 in. from the wall. However with a few models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To inspect the rough-in, just determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't approximately 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. The majority of home centers bring only one or 2 10-in. models and no 14-in. designs. If you need to special-order a toilet, be prepared to spend a lot more. If there's a door near the toilet, likewise determine how far the bowl protrudes from the wall. If you are changing a toilet with a standard bowl with an extended" model, the door might not close. Keep reading to discover how to install a toilet.</p>
