<p>The toilet takes a really very long time to flush. Here's how it works: Throughout normal operation, the pressure between the two check valves-- referred to as the zone of decreased pressure-- is maintained at a lower pressure than the supply pressure. If either check valve need to leak, the relief valve is developed to open and discharge water to the outside, making sure backflow never ever happens.</p>
