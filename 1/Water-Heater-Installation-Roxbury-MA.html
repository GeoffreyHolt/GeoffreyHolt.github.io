A normal water softener consists of a tall, narrow water-softener tank, and a brief, broad salt water tank. The softener tank is connected to the home's water-supply line. A small-diameter fill tube links the brine tank to the softener tank. And a discharge hose ranges from the softener tank to a close-by drain or drywell.</p>
