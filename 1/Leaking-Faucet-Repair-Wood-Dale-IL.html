<p>Wood pipes were used in London and elsewhere during the 16th and 17th centuries. The pipes were hollowed-out logs which were tapered at the end with a little hole in which the water would pass through. 21 The numerous pipes were then sealed together with hot animal fat. Wooden pipes were utilized in Philadelphia, 22 Boston, and Montreal in the 1800s. Built-up wood tubes were commonly utilized in the USA during the 20th century. These pipes (utilized in place of corrugated iron or enhanced concrete pipes) were made from sections cut from short lengths of wood. Locking of surrounding rings with wood dowel pins produced a flexible structure. About 100,000 feet of these wood pipes were set up during WW2 in drainage culverts, storm sewage systems and channels, under highways and at army camps, naval stations, airfields and ordnance plants.</p>
