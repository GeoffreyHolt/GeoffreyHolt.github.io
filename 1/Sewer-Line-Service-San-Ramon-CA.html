<p>An overall repipe of a home's water system, frequently done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most complex and costly plumbing job, states Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company focusing on whole home repiping. Plumbing problems aren't just tough to discover, they're likewise efficient in triggering some major damage.
