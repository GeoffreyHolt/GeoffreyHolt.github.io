<p>An overall repipe of a home's water system, frequently done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most complex and costly plumbing job, states Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company focusing on whole home repiping. Plumbing problems aren't just tough to discover, they're likewise efficient in triggering some major damage.

That is why we provide a 4-point toilet tune-up, where we (1) adjust the flush, (2) clean the seals, (3) replace the flapper and (4) perform a color test.</p>
