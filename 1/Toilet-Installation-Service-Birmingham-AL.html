However using PEX would cost simply $4,000 to $6,000, according to Gove. Since of lower material and labor expenses, that's. If it takes you 2 days to re-plumb a home with copper, you can do that very same house in a day with PEX," says Emanuel.</p>

The cost is roughly the same for setting up a propane gas line from the tank to the house as the cost to have gas go to your home. Discover which kind of gas your home currently has.
