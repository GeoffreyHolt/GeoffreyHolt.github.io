<p>As the name recommends, a backflow preventer works to ensure that liquids do not flow back against the required instructions of flow. When utilized in the context of a fire sprinkler system, a backflow preventer device is utilized to make sure that water does not flow from the sprinkler system back into the municipal water system, or other source of drinking water. Sadly, water held in the sprinkler system can become contaminated. If allowed to re-enter the water system, there is capacity for the contaminated water to end up being a health risk. The backflow preventer is planned to prevent water flowing back towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be checked frequently for efficiency, as well as examined each year by a fire inspection company in order to guarantee they are working as they should.</p>
