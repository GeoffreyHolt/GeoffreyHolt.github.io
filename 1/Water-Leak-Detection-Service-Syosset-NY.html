<p>We truly care about our clients and the services that we offer. As hard water goes through a softener, the calcium and magnesium trade locations with salt ions (Figure 1). Salt ions are held loosely and are changed easily by calcium and magnesium ions. Throughout this procedure, totally free" sodium ions are released into the water.
