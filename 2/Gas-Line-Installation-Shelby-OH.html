<p>I had a significant sewer problem with a 1940s house, with rainwater and sewage was supporting into the basement shower. I started calling any number I might find on Google. I really got their number for another company that could not come soon enough but referred me to Rate Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to examine and give me a price quote. They immediately cleared the initial obstruction, permitting the tenants to return from a hotel. Regrettably, upon additional examination, there was a substantial clog that required excavation to examine. His group was on site the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this preliminary issue and setting up a protective liner, it was determined that there was yet another break existed. This occurred yet a third time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
