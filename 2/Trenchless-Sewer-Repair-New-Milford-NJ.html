<h3>What Services Do Plumbers Provide New Milford NJ</h3>
<p>PEX pipes were thought to be a better alternative to polybutylene and galvanized piping. Regrettably, one brand name is experiencing a great deal of problems: Dura PEX. Dura PEX tends to have a great deal of oxidization. This causes fractures in the tubing that can cause leakages. As these leaks happen, zinc is seeped from the fittings on the pipes, causing them to deteriorate. Lastly, chlorinated water has been found to cause fractures in the clamps on these pipes. Repiping is the very best option to all of these concerns.</p>
