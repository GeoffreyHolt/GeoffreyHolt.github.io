<p>Hot water is essential, so do not take opportunities with a handyman or a Do It Yourself job.

<p>Tough water is softened by removing the calcium and magnesium it consists of. When tough water passes through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (hardness) ions are removed through an ion exchange process, so only softened water goes through to your house. Once the resin bed fills up with hardness ions, it must be regrowed (cleaned up). Salt is normally utilized in the regeneration procedure and restores the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange process can start again.</p>
<p>A water softener is a whole-house filtration system that gets rid of hardness-causing calcium and magnesium minerals from your water through a process called ion exchange.  A water softener addresses among the most destructive and widespread water problems: difficult water.  Difficult water wreaks havoc on the contemporary house. Scale builds up in your pipes, clogging them and decreasing water pressure.  Scale dramatically shortens the life-span of home appliances like dishwashers, coffee makers and ice devices. Hard water ruins warm water devices. The higher the temperature of the water, the more calcium and magnesium will harden and strengthen into strong deposits inside your warm water heater.</p>
