<p>DCVs are specifically designed to avoid backflow in fire sprinkler systems. The mainstay for typical fire defense applications, DCVs feature an inlet (upstream) shutoff valve, 2 individually operating spring-loaded check valves (generally inside a single valve body), four test dicks, and an outlet (downstream) shutoff valve. Light-duty commercial-grade garbage disposals begin around $500-$ 2,500 and increase depending upon size, brand name and functions.</p>
<p>For shallow pipes without any neighboring utilities or obstructions, digging through and changing the pipe by hand would likely be more affordable than relining it internally. Nevertheless, if your damaged pipe runs under your driveway, any large trees or pathways, dig-free pipe lining might save you as much as $10,000 in repair expenses, if not more. Set a pail under the P-trap and detach the drainpipes. Then eliminate the sink strainer. Remove any excess putty.</p>
