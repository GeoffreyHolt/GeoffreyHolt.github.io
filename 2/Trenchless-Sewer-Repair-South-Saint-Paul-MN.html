<p>A garbage disposal should not leak. When this occurs, it normally suggests wear and tear which is a reasonable indication that its time is up. If you consider what you put down the disposal, leaks can be unclean and will also eventually cause strain on other parts of your garbage disposal. The kitchen sink drain may need an easy tightening or a replacement. If the leak remains in the pressurized hose spray, you will see the obvious spray. For a leak in the drain pipe, you may have to fill the sink with water before analyzing the pipe below.</p>

We turn off the supply of water, get rid of old pipe and replace it with brand-new pipe. After the brand-new system is installed, we turn the water on and carry out tests on the new system.
