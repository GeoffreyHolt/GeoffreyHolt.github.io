<p>If you're purchasing a brand-new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the vast majority of toilets, the waste pipe is centered about 12 in. from the wall. However with a couple of models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To examine the rough-in, simply determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't roughly 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. A lot of home centers bring just one or two 10-in. designs and no 14-in. designs. If you have to special-order a toilet, be prepared to invest a lot more. If there's a door near the toilet, also measure how far the bowl protrudes from the wall. If you are replacing a toilet with a standard bowl with an elongated" model, the door might not close. Continue reading to learn how to install a toilet.</p>
