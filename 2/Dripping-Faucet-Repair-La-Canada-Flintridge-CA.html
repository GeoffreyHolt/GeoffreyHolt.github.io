<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to run, the control valve or valves must stay open and the system needs to be constantly kept an eye on. Therefore, there is a device on each control valve that either avoids the valve from being closed or sends out an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as basic as a locked chain through the control valve that prevents that valve from opening, or an alarm system that alerts the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems make use of both techniques. NFPA 13 refers to all such devices as supervisory devices.</p>
<p>When the water softening does not occur it might also suggest softener malfunction, or a problem with the salt that is used.
