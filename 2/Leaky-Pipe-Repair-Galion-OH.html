<p>When lime is added to the water, it changes the water chemistry, causing the calcium to come out of the solution. The particles of calcium integrate, end up being heavier than the rest of the water and sink to the bottom of the holding basins. The clear water then moves into the next action of the treatment procedure. Versatile gas lines are generally more suitable to inflexible lines, particularly in locations where earthquakes are more typical and for the connection in between the supply and home appliance.
