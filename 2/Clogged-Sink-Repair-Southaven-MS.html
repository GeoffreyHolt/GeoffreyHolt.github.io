If sewage from the City-maintained portion of the sewer system backs up through toilets or sinks, call the City's sewer and drainage maintenance personnel at (503) 823-1700. City employees will check and eliminate blockages in the mainline sewer and the portion of the service line that the City is responsible for. If the problem is the outcome of excessive storm water in the system, you might need to wait up until the storm has actually gone away to have actually the backup solved.</p>
<p>Solar water heaters: These affordable and environmentally friendly heaters draw energy from the sun to heat water. They need no electrical power or gas and can decrease your costs by an estimated 14 to 18%.

Another clog loomed. Even worse, the line might collapse requiring a significant repair or replacement.</p>
