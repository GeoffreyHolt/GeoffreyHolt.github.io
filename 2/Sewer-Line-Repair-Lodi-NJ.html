As the pipes continue to age, flakes of rust will accumulate in different parts of the plumbing system, the majority of commonly in shower heads, faucets, and shut-off valves. This can trigger low circulation issues and even stop a component from flowing completely.

<p>In many cases, our professionals will advise that you replace your hot water heater rather than purchase repairs. This is usually the case when the hot water heater is more than 10 years old or the cost of repairs would total more than half the cost of an entire new system. In some cases a frustrating toilet simply needs a small change and life is back to normal. That is why we provide a 4-point toilet tune-up, where we (1) adjust the flush, (2) clean the seals, (3) replace the flapper and (4) carry out a dye test.</p>
