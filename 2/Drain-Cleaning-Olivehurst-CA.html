<h3>Unclog Drains, Toilets and Sewers With The Help of Olivehurst CA Plumbers</h3>
<p>Rust is a complex phenomenon and there are numerous aspects that speed up corrosion in the drinking-water distribution system and facility plumbing. For years, there has been confusion surrounding cation -exchange softened water and corrosion, making it important to distinguish between naturally soft water and cation -exchange softened water Naturally soft water is destructive as it has a low pH and low TDS; however, cation -exchange water softening does not add to any aspects that accelerate deterioration Also, there is an absence of scientific evidence supporting the claim that hard-water scale is an effective kind of corrosion control. Therefore, considering all these aspects, as well as results from research study studies, WQA's position is that an effectively set up cation -exchange water softener does not make water more destructive.</p>
