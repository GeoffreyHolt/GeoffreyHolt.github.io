Now the resin beads pick up the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the firmness on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems include an entire home water filtration with its trademarked self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the liquified rock and dirt and sediment are sent out down the drain.
