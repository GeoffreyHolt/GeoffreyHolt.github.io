<h3>Necessary Services That A Good Plumbing Service Can Provide Key Biscayne FL</h3>
<p>The leak from a pipe fitting that costs less than a dollar can easily trigger thousands of dollars in water damage, interrupt your household for weeks, and toss your remodel way off schedule. So hiring a licensed, insured master plumber (or a well-trained apprentice working under his license) is a no-brainer. However not all plumbers deal with all types of work.

<p>You have galvanized iron pipes. I had Cost Busters replace a water heater tank and a main water shut off valve. They were timely and really responsive to send me a bid which was extremely competitive. They were really professional and did an incredible job. I would absolutely call them again for my plumbing requires. Now, if this discoloration only appears when hot water is being utilized, then the rust probably exists within your hot water heater tank and not in your pipes. This is of course still a problem that needs to be handled right now (you'll likely need a new hot water heater) but not one that needs repiping.</p>
