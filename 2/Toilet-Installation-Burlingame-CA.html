<p>Backflow implies the undesirable turnaround of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the potable water system; a backflow preventer is developed to keep this from happening. Points at which a potable water supply connects with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in devices such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, however they must be carefully designed and installed to prevent backflow. Another typical location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public water system.</p>
