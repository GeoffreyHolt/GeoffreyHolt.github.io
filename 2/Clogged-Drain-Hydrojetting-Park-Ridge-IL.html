<p><img src="https://plumbingimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/plumbing.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>In this circumstance, unclean water from the hillside swimming pool will back- siphon or back-flow down the hosepipe and into the clean water tank. Worms for watering systems: Homeowners found parasitical worms (nematodes) in their water after the atmospheric pressure breaker malfunctioned on a privately owned underground lawn sprinkler. During a water pressure drop, the vacuum in the system sucked some water from the sprinkler into the city water. The homeowner found worms swimming in the bathtub while filling it to shower his child.</p>
<p>Next, test the flapper as displayed in Photo 1. Water is most likely leaving through a cracked or corroded overflow tube if extra pressure on the flapper does not stop the running noise. In that case, you have to detach the tank from the bowl and replace the entire flush valve. Considering that the overflow tube is seldom the cause of a running toilet, we won't cover that repair here.</p>
