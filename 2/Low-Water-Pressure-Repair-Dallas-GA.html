<p>Root Intrusion: Root invasion describes what occurs when tree roots begin to grow around and into your drain and sewer lines This occurs due to the fact that the wetness in these lines is a natural fertilizer for tree roots. When roots ultimately do piece your drain lines, they can trigger obstructions, breaks, and back-ups which might result in substantial residential or commercial property damage.

<p>A new pattern in re-piping is sand blasting the inside of used thin pipe and the painting the inside of the worn pipe with epoxy paint. Sometimes throughout the sandblasting the sandblasting will use thin and blow through the wall of pipes and joints. A few of those thin areas leak immediately and in some cases those leakages come weeks or days later. Leaking pipes that are epoxy-coated end up needing to be appropriately re-piped by installing a CDA copper re-pipe.</p>
