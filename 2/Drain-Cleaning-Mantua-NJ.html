<p>A partial reroute is generally a little scale repiping of several affected locations of the plumbing beneath the slab. In cases where jackhammering and fixing the pipe are not cost effective, it is possible to only desert the affected area of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, walls and ceilings. Costing less than a full repipe, the end outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak again in the future. We have experienced houses having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can build up in cost very rapidly. This is the main reason that we will recommend a complete repipe in specific communities, based upon our experience.</p>
