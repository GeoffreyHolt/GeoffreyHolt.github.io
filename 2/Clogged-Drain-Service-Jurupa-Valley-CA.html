<p>While lots of hot water heater problems can be effectively fixed, some problems will demand complete hot water heater replacement. If your hot water heater is past its typical life expectancy (typically anywhere from 8 to ten years or longer if you have a tankless water heater) or if it has a significant leak or substantial rust, it might be time to think about replacement.</p>
<p>Electric hot water heater do have a couple of drawbacks nevertheless that are worth explaining. Primarily, electrical energy is not as cheap as gas. Some energy companies charge greater rates for electrical power throughout peak durations such as very early in the early morning and in the evening. Using your heater throughout these peak durations can increase your power costs. On the hand, gas is low-cost and has a set rate. Another drawback of an electric hot water heater is that they can be costly to install, particularly when it comes to whole-house tankless systems.</p>
<p>For the most part, a lack of warm water is brought on by a malfunctioning breaker or a broken high-temperature cutoff switch. The dip tube inside the tank may be cracked if the water is lukewarm. Scalding water is typically the outcome of a broken pressure relief valve or a bad thermostat. In either case, scalding water is dangerous and must be right away dealt with by a qualified plumbing professional.</p>
