<p>Deterioration: The most typical problem is rust in the tank and pipes that connect to your hot water heater. This is particularly true if you have unattended difficult water, which consists of harsh minerals that can connect to the piping and tank and break down the material with time.

<p>You have galvanized iron pipes. I had Price Busters replace a water heater tank and a main water turned off valve. They were really responsive and timely to send me a bid which was really competitive. They were very professional and did an amazing task. I would absolutely call them again for my plumbing requires. Now, if this discoloration just appears when warm water is being used, then the rust probably exists within your hot water heater tank and not in your pipes. This is obviously still a problem that needs to be dealt with immediately (you'll likely need a new water heater) but not one that requires repiping.</p>
