After removing standing water from the sink, put about 1/2 cup of table salt down the drain prior to you pour in the boiling water. Let it sit for a few minutes, and then flush with hot water to clear the mixture.</p>
<p>You have most likely seen drain cleaner items on the racks at your local house enhancement store, so when your drain gets clogged or isn't draining pipes water like it should, you might be lured to head down there and select some as much as fix it by yourself.
