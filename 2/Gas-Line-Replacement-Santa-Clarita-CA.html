<p>To figure out which toilet valve is triggering the trouble, look at the overflow tube. If water is overruning into the tube, there's a problem with the toilet fill valve. If the water level is listed below the top of the tube, the flush valve is leaking, enabling water to drip into the bowl. That sluggish, consistent outflow of water prevents the fill valve from closing totally. We removed the fronts and backs of brand-new toilets to reveal you how to replace these toilet tank parts. Your toilet and toilet tank parts will not look so pristine inside. You'll find scummy surfaces, water spots and corrosion.
