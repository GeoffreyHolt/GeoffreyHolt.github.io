Our extensive water quality program operates 24 hr a day, 365 days a year, to ensure that the water provided to our customers is kept free from hazardous pollutants. An important part of our water quality program is the backflow prevention program When a water line is linked to equipment containing a nonpotable compound, this is referred to as a cross-connection. Contamination may occur when water flows through a cross-connection from a nonpotable source, such as a sprinkler system or cooling and heating system, into the safe and clean water system. This can happen through a process referred to as backflow.</p>
<p>Though water line replacement sounds like your house's equivalent of major surgical treatment, it's really something we at Gotelli Plumbing handle regularly. When your water lines are repiped, it simply indicates old copper and galvanized pipes are changed with brand-new pipes. We find that houses 15 years or older who have never had repiping work are the most likely candidates for water line replacement.

We find that repiping can in fact be the cheaper and better long-term option if you do have frequent leaks.</p>

For instance, California has rigorous guidelines regarding underground gas line installation since of earthquakes and other natural disasters. Piping needs to be at least 18 inches listed below ground for safer areas and 24 inches for places at greater threat of external damage.</p>
