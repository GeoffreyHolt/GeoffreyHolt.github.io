<h3>Clogged Pipes in Greenwood Arkansas</h2>
<p>A malfunctioning waste disposal unit, grease accumulation, accumulated food and more can all add to a clogged kitchen sink. The sink is the focal point in the kitchen and when you have a clogged kitchen sink, that will cause problems. There are a variety of methods house owners can unclog a kitchen sink, including using a sink plunger, snaking the drain, or utilizing an option of vinegar and baking soda. For the more serious clogged kitchen sinks, call your local Wingate plumber.</p>
<p>Among the most common bathroom plumbing problems to occur is a clogged toilet. In fact, much of us keep a plunger near our toilet in case it ever must clog. While a plunger can quickly fix most clogs, in some cases toilets end up being totally overwhelmed with toilet paper or non-flushable products. We recommend that you call in one of our professional plumbers to help you unclog your toilet when this happens.</p>
