<p>The labor expenses for disposal installation are primarily time related. If whatever is ready, in excellent condition, and the disposal is on hand and easily put in, the plumber will likely just charge for an hour or two of time. If things need to be customized, changed, or transferred to accommodate the disposal, this will take longer, and will up the number of hours needed and therefore the overall costs. A lot of plumbers charge between $45 and $65 per hour, with a lot of disposal setups running $50 per hour for 3 hours total, making the labor costs approximately $150.</p>

You'll also discover a drain valve near the tank bottom, and a control unit outside for setting temperatures and controlling the pilot-light valve.</p>
