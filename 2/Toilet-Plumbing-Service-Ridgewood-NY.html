However in order to reap the benefits of a brand-new energy-efficient home appliance, you'll need to have it set up appropriately.

Prior to you install this kind of ring, hold it up to the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may need to cut off a couple of ears to make it deal with your toilet. You'll have to replace a section of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>
