A normal water softener consists of a high, narrow water-softener tank, and a brief, broad brine tank. The softener tank is linked to the home's water-supply line. A small-diameter fill tube links the brine tank to the softener tank. And a discharge hose runs from the softener tank to a nearby drain or drywell.</p>
