Scale and biofilm won't build-up, and the signal also chips away at already existing accumulation. Hydropath Technology, which powers the HydroFLOW gadgets, is effective and uniquely efficient compared to other water conditioning alternatives on the marketplace today.

This allows them to work to their complete capacity and to last longer than they otherwise would.</p>
<p>In time, the resin beads in the water softener will end up being covered with calcium and magnesium ions, decreasing their capacity to soften hard water. Through a procedure called regrowth, water is instantly flushed through the water softener with a concentrated amount of regenerant. Now the resin beads get the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the solidity on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems include an entire home water filtration with its trademarked self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the dissolved rock and dirt and sediment are sent out down the drain. With the resin beads recharged," the water softener goes back to service, supplying the entire house with clean, soft water.</p>
