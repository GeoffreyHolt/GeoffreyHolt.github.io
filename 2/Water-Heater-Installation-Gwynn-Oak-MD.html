<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is only half the equation! To simply pour some media inside a tank and wish for the best is typical in our market and lots of companies attempt to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Again, years of experience and thorough testing led us to develop a tank that fluidizes the media bed much better than any other design on the marketplace. Fluidization is the key to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media converts the hardness in the water to calcite crystals which will not stick to anything even under extreme temperatures. It's only with the media and the fluidization correctly working together that you can attain this.</p>
