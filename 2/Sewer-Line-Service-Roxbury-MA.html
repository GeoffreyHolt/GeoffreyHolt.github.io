It needed to be hauled by a truck and included a 10 hp gas engine and 1000 feet of steel cable television. It was capable of cleaning large industrial and municipal sewer pipes. An improved version called "The Mainliner" was introduced in 1958 that could also thread telephone cable television. It was stopped in 1973.</p>
