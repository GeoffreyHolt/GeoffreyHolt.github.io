A license is not needed for repairs which involve only the working parts of a faucet or valve or clearance of blockages provided changes are not made in the existing piping or components.

A small-diameter fill tube connects the brine tank to the softener tank. And a discharge hose ranges from the softener tank to a neighboring drainpipe or drywell.</p>
