<p>Noise is typical, but when you see that the noises are all there however food is not being ground up it is most likely that the motor has gone. Some sounds indicate the need for repairs or a great clean out, and you can offer the system a great check before starting to price brand-new ones. But if your disposal is old enough, repairs will cost you cash for extremely little future usage.</p>
<p>To prep your system for installation, you may have to attach a cable with a plug to reach the outlet, or extension wires to reach a hardwired box In this case, I attached a cord with a plug package that I purchased independently from the disposal system. It's as simple as feeding the wires from the cable through the disposal and attaching them to the matching colors on the system with wire nuts.</p>
<p>Although these property owners didn't feel fortunate at the time, it was definitely great timing to camera the line prior to collapsing. The pipe was in sufficient shape to reline prior to the issue got worse. Waiting simply wasn't a choice. The line was 12 feet deep and went under a separated garage. At the least, it would have been a very costly alternative.</p>
