<p>Some makers declare that the electrical gadgets they produce can affect the interaction of minerals with water so that the minerals do not bind to surfaces. Since these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like traditional water softeners do, one benefit claimed for the user is the elimination of the need to include salt to the system. While particle size decrease and plant growth promotion have been claimed, such systems do not eliminate minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can only modify the downstream results that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of specific systems has shown a reduction of calcium scale formation. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" but rather "water conditioning".</p>

Our extensive water quality program operates 24 hr a day, 365 days a year, to guarantee that the water provided to our customers is kept devoid of damaging pollutants.

Contamination might occur when water flows through a cross-connection from a nonpotable source, such as a sprinkler system or heating & cooling system, into the safe and clean water system. This can happen through a procedure referred to as backflow.</p>

Sanford & Child plumbing offers sink repair and replacement services to all Lake Elsinore, Temecula, Murrieta, Sun City, Menifee, Wildomar, and surrounding locations. Throughout regeneration, salted water from the salt water tank flows up the fill tube and into the softener tank. A rinse cycle commences and the salted water cleans the mineral deposits off the resin beads. The regenerated water and the mineral deposits are flushed out the discharge hose. The system then reverts back to softening the inbound water.</p>
