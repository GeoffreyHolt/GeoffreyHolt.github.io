Indoor gas leakages from heaters, ranges, ovens and other gas-burning devices take place most frequently in the winter.

If you haven't done so already, we advise setting up carbon monoxide gas detectors beyond bedroom doors to inform you of any potential gas leakages.</p>

<p>All of the drains in your house, from your toilets, sinks, tubs, and showers all drain into one main drain under your house then exit into the sewer or septic system from your house. Then that typically means that your main sewer line is backing up when you experience clogs in several drains at when in your home. This can occur in numerous locations and any combination of drains. For instance, water may fill in your bathtub when you run your washing machine. There are several combinations of this kind of backup. The point is your drains all connect, and when you have a backup in your main sewer line, you'll experience backup and overflowing from multiple drain lines in your home.</p>
