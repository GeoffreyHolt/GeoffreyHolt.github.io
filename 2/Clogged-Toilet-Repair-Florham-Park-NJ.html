<p>Backpressure backflow is caused by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's drinkable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the safe and clean supply of water pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the safe and clean water system pressure, or a mix of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be developed by pumps, temperature increases in boilers, and so on. Reductions in drinkable water system pressure take place whenever the amount of water being utilized exceeds the amount of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>

<p>What is hard water? Clinically speaking, it is water which contains significant amounts of dissolved minerals, specifically calcium and magnesium. As water trickles through rocks, limestone deposits and soil, it picks up these minerals on its journey. Depending upon how long the water takes a trip through the ground before reaching your tap, it can get a lot of these minerals, making water harder in some regions than others. While the minerals won't harm your health, they can leave insoluble mineral deposits, making the water inappropriate-- and quite a nuisance-- for its many intended usages around your house.</p>
