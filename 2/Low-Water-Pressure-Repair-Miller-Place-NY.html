<p>Inside the house, examine the kitchen faucets and bathroom faucets for leaks or drips. Check underneath sinks to check for leaking pipes. Local plumber estimated price of $400 to install plus cost of waste disposal unit. I went to Lowe's and got disposal for $179 plus tax Installation by Lowe' was $ delighted I checked around. Under the sink, place a container or pan underneath the waste pipe, then use locking-jaw pliers or a monkey wrench to detach the old disposal's tailpiece from the drain line's drain. To loosen the nut, turn it counterclockwise.</p>
<p>Although these house owners didn't feel lucky at the time, it was definitely great timing to camera the line prior to collapsing. The pipe remained in sufficient shape to reline before the problem became worse. Waiting just wasn't an alternative. The line was 12 feet deep and went under a removed garage. At the least, it would have been a really costly alternative.</p>
