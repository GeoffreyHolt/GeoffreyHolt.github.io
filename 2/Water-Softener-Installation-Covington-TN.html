For blockages that occur even more down the pipe, use a cable auger or plumber's snake. These tools are made from long, flexible steel cable injury around a spool with a hand crank. To use a cable auger, eliminate the horizontal P-trap below the sink, making certain it is not clogged prior to proceeding.
