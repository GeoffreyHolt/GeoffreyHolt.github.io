<p>Foul Sewer Odor: One of the very first most apparent signs of a sewer concern is a smell of sewage when you flush the toilet, or in the backyard (in the area where your sewer line would be). This can be a basic issue such as a broken water seal, or it can suggest a larger problem such as a broken sewer pipe. Drain repairs can avoid serious damage to your house.

<p>After getting here after their window, they began to examine the kitchen sink (and after among the two gentlemen tossed up outside), they ran a snake down the sink and then put the sink back together but claimed they would not take responsibility if it dripped now because of some unspecified quirks in how my sink was created. After they gave me the "do not put grease down the sink" lecture and they left, I saw they managed to reassemble the sink in such a manner in which the sprayer hose was twisted around the plumbing. I didn't even bother to try calling them back, because I never wish to see this company again.</p>

Whether tree roots have made their method into your pipes or you flushed something you shouldn't have, a clogged toilet is never ever a pleasant experience.
