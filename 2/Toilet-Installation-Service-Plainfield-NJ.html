<p>Backflow preventers are crucial for developing a safe water supply system. No matter which model you select, all water softeners need to be effectively maintained. The brine service should be blended and stored in the brine tank. Periodic clogging of the resin likewise needs special attention. For example, if the raw water system is turbid it may clog the resin with mud and clay. In some cases, typical backwashing with water will solve this issue. If not, slowly stir the resin throughout the backwash cycle to help separate the product. Similarly, fungis and bacteria also form mats in the resin that lower its efficiency. Sanitizing the water prior to softening or occasionally cleaning the softener with chlorine bleach will remove these problems. However, check out the manufacturer's directions prior to adding any chemicals to the system.</p>
