<p>Backflow preventers are important for creating a safe water supply system. No matter which design you choose, all water softeners need to be properly preserved. The salt water solution need to be blended and kept in the brine tank. Periodic clogging of the resin also requires unique attention. For instance, if the raw water supply is turbid it may clog the resin with mud and clay. In some cases, typical backwashing with water will solve this problem. If not, gradually stir the resin during the backwash cycle to help break up the product. Similarly, fungis and bacteria likewise form mats in the resin that minimize its efficiency. Sanitizing the water prior to softening or periodically cleaning the softener with chlorine bleach will eliminate these problems. Nevertheless, read the producer's directions before adding any chemicals to the unit.</p>

Repiping a home can draw from a few hours for a simple minor pipe repair or replacement, or it can take up to a week for bigger homes needing the entire plumbing system repiped.
