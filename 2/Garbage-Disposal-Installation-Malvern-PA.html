<p>The Final Jeopardy answer, you ask? The device that regulates water flow in your toilet. If you look behind your toilet, you'll see a supply line that runs from the outlet in the wall to the bottom of the toilet fill valve. This is how water enters into your toilet. After you flush the toilet, the fill valve opens to fill up the water in the tank and the toilet bowl, readying the system for the next flush. If your fill valve is broken, not set at the right level, or isn't installed appropriately, you might experience a regularly or continuously "running" toilet - which can cost you numerous dollars in wasted water.</p>

<p>As the name recommends, a backflow preventer works to make sure that liquids do not flow back versus the needed direction of circulation. When used in the context of a fire lawn sprinkler, a backflow preventer device is used to ensure that water does not stream from the lawn sprinkler back into the community supply of water, or other source of drinking water. Sadly, water kept in the lawn sprinkler can end up being polluted. If enabled to re-enter the supply of water, there is potential for the infected water to end up being a health danger. The backflow preventer is planned to avoid water flowing back towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be checked routinely for effectiveness, along with inspected annually by a fire inspection company in order to guarantee they are working as they should.</p>
