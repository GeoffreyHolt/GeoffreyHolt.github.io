Blanc also built a much larger variation of the Roto-Rooter machine called the Roto-Rooter Royal. It needed to be pulled by a truck and included a 10 hp gas engine and 1000 feet of steel cable television. It was capable of cleaning big commercial and local sewer pipes. An enhanced version called "The Mainliner" was presented in 1958 that might also thread telephone cable. It was terminated in 1973.</p>
