<p>Zurn Industries: In addition to supplying an extensive line of backflow preventers, most of Zurn Wilkins' plumbing components satisfy and go beyond the standards developed by the Safe Drinking Water Act and lead-free initiative. Current changes to the Safe Drinking Water Act mandated that all commercial plumbing fixtures, valves, pipes, and fittings that are directly intended for human water consumption are required to be manufactured with less than 0.25 percent leaded brass material. Zurn Wilkins plumbing products that fall within this category have been designated lead-free," meaning they are certified.</p>
<p>To figure out which toilet valve is causing the problem, take a look at the overflow tube. If water is overruning into television, there's a problem with the toilet fill valve. If the water level is below the top of the tube, the flush valve is leaking, permitting water to drip into the bowl. That sluggish, consistent outflow of water avoids the fill valve from closing completely. We cut away the fronts and backs of new toilets to reveal you how to replace these toilet tank parts. Your toilet and toilet tank parts won't look so pristine inside. You'll find scummy surface areas, water discolorations and rust. But don't be squeamish-- the water is as clean as the things that comes out of your faucets.</p>
