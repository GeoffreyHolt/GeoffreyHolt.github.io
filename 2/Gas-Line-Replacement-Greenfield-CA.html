<p>Backflow preventers should just be fixed when the information gathered from the field test indicates the assembly has broken down in its performance below the developed minimum standard. The test treatment is a diagnostic assessment of the operations of a backflow preventer. When the backflow preventer fails to meet this minimum standard, the backflow preventer should be repaired or if required, replaced. These minimum standards are set at a level that as the backflow prevention assembly begins to deteriorate in its efficiency, it can still avoid backflow. The function of a repair is to return the assembly back to its original factory working requirements. This implies the assembly is repaired so that it can perform above the minimum standard.</p>

<p>According to the Epa, cross-connections can be a major public health risk if they do not have appropriate backflow prevention assemblies installed. There are many, well-documented cases in which cross-connections have been accountable for contamination of drinking water that, when consumed, caused the spread of sickness or illness.</p>
<p>A plumbing license offers three inspections. Additional inspections are $50.00 each. Inspections contacted on work not completed, not properly installed, or on an inaccessible home will need re-inspection. It is the license holder's duty to reschedule the inspection and make arrangements for the plumbing inspector to access the residential or commercial property.</p>
<p>A cross connection is a connection in between a potable drinking supply of water and a possible source of contamination or pollution. Under the arrangements of the Safe Drinking Water Act of 1971, the Epa (EPA) established national requirements for safe drinking water. Each state is needed to implement the numerous regulations of the Safe Drinking Water Act and how it relates to its state laws.</p>
