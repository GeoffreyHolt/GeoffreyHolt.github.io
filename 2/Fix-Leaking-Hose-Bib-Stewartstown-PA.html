<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to operate, the control valve or valves should stay open and the system must be continuously kept track of. For that reason, there is a device on each control valve that either avoids the valve from being closed or sends an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as basic as a locked chain through the control valve that prevents that valve from opening, or an alarm that notifies the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems utilize both techniques. NFPA 13 refers to all such devices as supervisory devices.</p>
<p>Some states require pipefitters and steamfitters to be licensed; they may likewise need an unique license to work on gas lines. Licensing usually requires an exam or work experience or both.
