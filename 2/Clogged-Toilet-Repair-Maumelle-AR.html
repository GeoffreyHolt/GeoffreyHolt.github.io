<p>When the data collected from the field test suggests the assembly has actually broken down in its efficiency below the developed minimum basic, backflow preventers need to only be fixed. The test procedure is a diagnostic evaluation of the functions of a backflow preventer. When the backflow preventer fails to satisfy this minimum basic, the backflow preventer need to be repaired or if necessary, changed. These minimum standards are set at a level that as the backflow prevention assembly begins to weaken in its performance, it can still avoid backflow. The purpose of a repair is to return the assembly back to its original factory working specs. This indicates the assembly is fixed so that it can carry out above the minimum requirement.</p>
