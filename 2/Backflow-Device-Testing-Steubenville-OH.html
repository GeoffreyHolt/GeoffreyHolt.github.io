<p>The Last Jeopardy response, you ask? The device that manages water circulation in your toilet. You'll see a supply line that runs from the outlet in the wall to the bottom of the toilet fill valve if you look behind your toilet. This is how water enters into your toilet. After you flush the toilet, the fill valve opens to refill the water in the toilet and the tank bowl, readying the system for the next flush. If your fill valve is broken, not set at the appropriate level, or isn't set up properly, you may experience an often or continuously "running" toilet - which can cost you numerous dollars in lost water.</p>
