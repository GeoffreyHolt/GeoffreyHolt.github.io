<h3>Emergency Plumbing Tips For Your Everyday Plumber Painted Post NY</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Instead of a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has actually been sized to handle peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to effectively get used to your service' flow rates throughout the day. During periods of high circulation demand, tanks come online to add circulation rate capacity. During durations of low flow need, tanks go off-line. This new method to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation innovation, and it's arguably the most important innovation in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
