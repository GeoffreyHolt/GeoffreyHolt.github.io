<p>As the name recommends, a backflow preventer works to guarantee that liquids do not flow back versus the needed direction of circulation. When used in the context of a fire lawn sprinkler, a backflow preventer device is utilized to make sure that water does not flow from the lawn sprinkler back into the local water supply, or other source of drinking water. Regrettably, water held in the sprinkler system can end up being contaminated. If allowed to return to the water system, there is capacity for the polluted water to end up being a health threat. The backflow preventer is intended to avoid water receding towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be examined routinely for effectiveness, along with inspected every year by a fire inspection company in order to ensure they are working as they should.</p>
