<p>To identify which toilet valve is causing the problem, look at the overflow tube. There's an issue with the toilet fill valve if water is overruning into the tube.

That slow, continuous outflow of water prevents the fill valve from closing entirely. We removed the fronts and backs of new toilets to reveal you how to replace these toilet tank parts. Your toilet and toilet tank parts won't look so pristine inside. You'll find scummy surface areas, water stains and deterioration.
