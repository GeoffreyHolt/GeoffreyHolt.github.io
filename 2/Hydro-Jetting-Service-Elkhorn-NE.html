Calcium, magnesium and many other minerals carry positive charges, so water softeners use salt ions, which are "exchanged" with the calcium and magnesium ions. If you water with drinkable water, you are required to have two backflow preventers, one at the meter and another one on the watering line at the point of connection. If you have two meters, potable and watering, you are also required to have two backflow preventers, one at each meter.</p>
