These flanges are commonly readily available and simple to install, costing around $30 at home enhancement or hardware stores. Turn off the supply of water to your house at the main line. To prevent leakages from springing during the installation procedure, shut down the water supply to your house. Ensure your hot water heater's water system is switched off, as is the electrical power going to the unit.</p>
