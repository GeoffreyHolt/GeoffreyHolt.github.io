<p>Backflow preventers need to just be repaired when the information gathered from the field test indicates the assembly has actually deteriorated in its efficiency listed below the developed minimum basic. The test treatment is a diagnostic examination of the operations of a backflow preventer. When the backflow preventer stops working to meet this minimum basic, the backflow preventer must be fixed or if needed, changed. These minimum standards are set at a level that as the backflow prevention assembly begins to deteriorate in its efficiency, it can still avoid backflow. The purpose of a repair is to return the assembly back to its original factory working requirements. This means the assembly is fixed so that it can perform above the minimum requirement.</p>
