<p>The most effective method to address tough water is with a water softener. When calcium and magnesium-- the firmness ions-- are collected by tiny resin beads through a procedure called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with salt or potassium ions. When difficult water is available in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are taken out of the water and replaced with sodium or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>Responsibility for installation falls upon the owner of the residential or commercial property or the co-op or apartment board. Owners and boards of buildings that are released an order by the DEP to install a backflow preventer need to file strategies with the DEP within 30 days. If the DEP has not received certification from a PE, RA, or LMP that the backflow preventer is at least in the process of being set up within that time, a Notification of Infraction will be sent. Violators will be responsible for a civil penalty of up to $1,000 issued by the Environmental Control Board (ECB). Continued non-compliance can eventually lead to criminal and civil proceedings and actions, as well as the termination of water service to the building.</p>
