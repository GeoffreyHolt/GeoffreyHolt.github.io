Many houses in the United States, consisting of Tampa Bay Area, have what is referred to as a Flush Toilet.  Toilets likewise have a flapper seal made of rubber at the bottom of the cistern that keeps the water in the tank till the toilet is flushed.  This seal deteriorates with time enabling water to escape into the toilet bowl, thus minimizing the amount of water in the tank readily available for a flush.

You'll see a supply line that runs from the outlet in the wall to the bottom of the toilet fill valve if you look behind your toilet. This is how water enters into your toilet. After you flush the toilet, the fill valve opens to refill the water in the tank and the toilet bowl, readying the system for the next flush. If your fill valve is broken, not set at the appropriate level, or isn't set up correctly, you may experience a frequently or continuously "running" toilet - which can cost you hundreds of dollars in lost water.</p>
