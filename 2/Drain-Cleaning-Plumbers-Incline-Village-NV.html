<p>Two designs of PVBs are available: (1) Pressure Vacuum Breaker and (2) Spill Resistant Vacuum Breaker. A PVB is a mechanical backflow prevention assembly that consists of an individually acting, spring-loaded check valve and a separately acting, spring-loaded, air inlet valve on the discharge side of the check valve. It consists of shutoff valves at each end of the assembly and is equipped with test dicks. A PVB might be utilized to isolate health or non-health hazards but is effective versus back-siphonage only.</p>
<p>The Plumbing and Gasfitting Board recommends the Director of the Department of Permits, Approvals and Inspections regarding the administration of Short article 21, Title 15 of the Baltimore County Code, consisting of licensing. Backsiphonage occurs when there is a negative pressure in the water distribution system, which draws the water from a private water supply into the general public water system. This can take place at any time, such as throughout a water pipe break or throughout a big firefighting effort.</p>
