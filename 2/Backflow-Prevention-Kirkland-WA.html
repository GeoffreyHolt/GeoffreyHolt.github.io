<h3>Plumber Installation & Repair Service Kirkland WA</h3>

We regularly train on the most modern commercial plumbing methods and just utilize the best quality products. Universal Plumbing uses a total line of gas and electric commercial hot water heater.

<p>Water softeners overcome a procedure called ion exchange which removes calcium and magnesium from the water. When the hard water enters into the mineral tank, it streams through a bed of spherical resin beads These plastic beads, normally made from polystyrene, are charged with a sodium ion. The resin beads are anions, suggesting they have an unfavorable charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a positive charge, making them cations. Because opposite charges bring in, the unfavorable charge of the minerals is brought in to the positive charge of the resin beads. As the tough water travels through the resin, the beads get ahold of the mineral ions and eliminate them from the water. When the bead seizes the mineral ion, the sodium ion is launched. The column of resin strips all the hardness out of the water as it goes through the mineral tank, and softened water flows out into your house.</p>
