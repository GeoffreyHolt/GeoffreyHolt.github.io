<p>Recently we were called by a couple to unclog a main sewer line in between their new home and the city sewer. After clearing the drain we used our sewer camera to examine the line and identify the reason for the issue. The line was plainly degrading; some sections were only held together by the ground around them. Another clog was imminent. Even even worse, the line could collapse requiring a significant repair or replacement.</p>
