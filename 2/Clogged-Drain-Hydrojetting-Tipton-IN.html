<p>During regular operation, the pressure in between the two check valves, described as the zone of lowered pressure, is preserved at a lower pressure than the supply pressure. If either check valve need to leak, the relief valve is designed to open and discharge water to the exterior.

For this factor, the RPZ needs to be set up in areas that are not subject to water damage and enable appropriate drainage.</p>
