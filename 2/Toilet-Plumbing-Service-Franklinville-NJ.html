To simply put some media inside a tank and wish for the best is typical in our industry and lots of companies attempt to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Once again, years of experience and comprehensive testing led us to develop a tank that fluidizes the media bed much better than any other design on the marketplace. Fluidization is the key to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media transforms the firmness in the water to calcite crystals which will not adhere to anything even under extreme temperature levels. It's only with the media and the fluidization effectively collaborating that you can achieve this.</p>
