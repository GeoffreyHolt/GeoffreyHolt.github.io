<p>Tough water is softened by removing the calcium and magnesium it consists of. When hard water travels through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (solidity) ions are gotten rid of through an ion exchange process, so just softened water travels through to your house. Once the resin bed fills with firmness ions, it needs to be regenerated (cleaned up). Salt is generally used in the regrowth process and brings back the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange process can begin once again.</p>
<p>At least once per week, run hot water through the drains. This will clean them out rapidly and avoid any materials from solidifying to the side of the pipe.

<p>In municipal water system systems, water is generally kept at a significant pressure to make it possible for water to flow to and out of the plumbing fixtures in your house or organisation. When the pressure drops for some factor such as may take place when the fire department links to a fire hydrant to fight a fire or a water main breaks or some other situation happens, polluted water might be drawn into the system. To avoid such an event, there needs to be some type of backflow prevention method used. The best and safest type of backflow prevention is an air space (a physical separation between the water outlet and the rim of the fixture). If an air space is not possible, then the proper backflow prevention device is needed. This backflow device is considered a containment" backflow preventer and is controlled by the Ohio Epa and your water supplier.</p>
