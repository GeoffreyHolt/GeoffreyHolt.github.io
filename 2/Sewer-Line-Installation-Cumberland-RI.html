<h3>What Causes Pipe and Drain Clogs in Cumberland RI?</h3>
<p>What is tough water? Clinically speaking, it is water that contains considerable amounts of dissolved minerals, particularly calcium and magnesium. As water trickles through rocks, limestone deposits and soil, it gets these minerals on its journey. Depending upon how long the water takes a trip through the ground before reaching your tap, it can get a lot of these minerals, making water harder in some regions than others. While the minerals will not harm your health, they can leave insoluble mineral deposits, making the water inappropriate-- and rather a nuisance-- for its many intended usages around your house.</p>

An improved version called "The Mainliner" was introduced in 1958 that could also thread telephone cable television. It was ceased in 1973.</p>
