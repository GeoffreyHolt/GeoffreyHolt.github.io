<h3>What Causes Pipe and Drain Clogs in Cumberland RI?</h3>
<p>What is tough water? Clinically speaking, it is water that contains considerable amounts of dissolved minerals, particularly calcium and magnesium. As water trickles through rocks, limestone deposits and soil, it gets these minerals on its journey.

While the minerals will not harm your health, they can leave insoluble mineral deposits, making the water inappropriate-- and rather a nuisance-- for its many intended usages around your house.</p>
