For years, there has been confusion surrounding cation -exchange softened water and deterioration, making it essential to compare naturally soft water and cation -exchange softened water Naturally soft water is destructive as it has a low pH and low TDS; however, cation -exchange water softening does not add to any factors that speed up corrosion Likewise, there is an absence of scientific proof supporting the claim that hard-water scale is an efficient form of deterioration control.
