<p>Another downside of water softening through ion exchange is the possible health threat for individuals on low sodium diet plans. Ion exchange increases the amount of sodium in water, in order to reduce its mineral content. Generally, this process adds 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending on how hard the water was to start with. More difficult water will lead to more salt, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For the majority of people, this boost in sodium is minor, however if you've been encouraged by a doctor to follow a strict low sodium diet plan this boost can pose problems.</p>
