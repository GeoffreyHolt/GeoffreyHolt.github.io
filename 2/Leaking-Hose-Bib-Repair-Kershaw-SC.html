<h3>Emergency Plumbing Repair Kershaw SC</h3>
<p>PEX pipes were thought to be a better option to galvanized and polybutylene piping. Sadly, one brand name is experiencing a lot of problems: Dura PEX. Dura PEX tends to have a great deal of oxidization. This causes fractures in the tubing that can result in leakages. As these leakages occur, zinc is leached from the fittings on the pipes, triggering them to degrade. Finally, chlorinated water has been discovered to trigger cracks in the clamps on these pipes. Repiping is the very best solution to all of these concerns.</p>
