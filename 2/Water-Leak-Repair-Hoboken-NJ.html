<p>Day to day use should not cause a water softener to leak. Leaks can also occur if you run into the softener and jostle it, pulling the fitting apart. To prevent this from happening, install the unit in a steady and safe area. If you reside in an earthquake-prone area of the country, secure the softener so that if the foundation starts moving, the softener does not tip over and remove the plumbing. If your water softener is leaking during regrowth, you need to wait till after the cycle is completed and then checked the system for cracks or broken fittings. You must also inspect to make sure your drain line is never blocked up with particles. A clogged drain line can blow off of the softener throughout regeneration and flood your basement or garage.</p>
