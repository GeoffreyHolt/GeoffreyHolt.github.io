<p>In the average repair, the old rubber parts need to be eliminated and replaced with new rubber parts. When putting the backflow prevention assembly back together whether they are hardware or rubber parts, it is essential that just initial factory repair parts are used.

<p>Water softeners overcome a procedure called ion exchange which gets rid of calcium and magnesium from the water. When the tough water enters into the mineral tank, it streams through a bed of round resin beads These plastic beads, generally made from polystyrene, are charged with a salt ion. The resin beads are anions, indicating they have a negative charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a positive charge, making them cations. Given that opposite charges draw in, the negative charge of the minerals is attracted to the positive charge of the resin beads. As the hard water passes through the resin, the beads get ahold of the mineral ions and remove them from the water. When the bead seizes the mineral ion, the sodium ion is released. The column of resin strips all the solidity out of the water as it goes through the mineral tank, and softened water flows out into your home.</p>
