Mr. Singh did at least 3 attempts to clear the main drain, however the downstairs sink still had standing water in the bowl. Using his understanding and experience he identified that the drain system from the upstairs sink was clear but the backup remained in the branch to the downstairs sink. With a little coaxing, much to my delight, the sink cleared and all the debris went down the freshly cleaned up main drain. By adding perseverence and perseverance the task was done to my total fulfillment.</p>

Remove it and take it to the shop to discover a match if you decide to hunt for a washer. Plumbers typically replace the entire fill valve rather than hunt for a replacement washer.</p>
