The broken sewer line guides the brand-new piping into place. All new replacement pipes have a projected lifespan of one hundred years and are code compliant, chemical-resistant, root-resistant, and leak proof. Another effective strategy is pipe relining. Pipe relining essentially gets rid of the need for broken pipe elimination.
