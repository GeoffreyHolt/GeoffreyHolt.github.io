<p>Backflow preventers are crucial for producing a safe water system system. No matter which model you pick, all water softeners need to be effectively maintained. The salt water solution should be mixed and kept in the salt water tank. Periodic clogging of the resin also requires unique attention. For instance, if the raw water system is turbid it may clog the resin with mud and clay. Sometimes, normal backwashing with water will solve this issue. If not, slowly stir the resin throughout the backwash cycle to help break up the material. Likewise, fungis and germs also form mats in the resin that decrease its effectiveness. Sanitizing the water prior to softening or periodically cleaning the softener with chlorine bleach will remove these nuisances. However, read the manufacturer's directions prior to adding any chemicals to the system.</p>
