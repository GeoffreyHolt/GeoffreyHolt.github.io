<p>Offering quality and professional repair, replacement, and installation services for your plumbing. Some jurisdictions also allow options to backflow preventers. For example, Philadelphia's water district requires all residential systems supplying devoted sprinkler heads to have a connection from the lawn sprinkler to the toilet tank that's farthest from the supply of water. This removes the need for a backflow preventer, due to the fact that whenever that toilet is flushed, it draws water through the fire line to keep the water fresh.</p>
<p>We had an excellent experience with Joe Boyette, he was really professional, considerate, skilled. We had a great deal of plumbing repair after a fire for over a 2 month duration.

We made the decision to stick with Joe, despite the fact that we felt Mr Rooter prices were certainly on the high end. This being posted by Barbara Boyer from Atlanta.</p>
