I really received their number for another company that could not come quickly enough however referred me to Rate Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to investigate and offer me a quote. They immediately cleared the initial clog, allowing for the tenants to return from a hotel. Regrettably, upon more investigation, there was a considerable clog that required excavation to examine. His group was on site the extremely next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this initial concern and setting up a protective liner, it was identified that there was yet another break existed.
