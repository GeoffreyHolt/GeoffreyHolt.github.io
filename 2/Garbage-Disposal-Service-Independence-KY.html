<p>New houses built with copper pipes are specifically susceptible to destructive water conditions because the copper pipes have not had a chance to become layered within. As advised by the MDH, it is best NOT to soften the water in a new home for a duration of 3 to five months after occupancy. This can be done by just bypassing the water softener's filter medium. See your owner's manual for directions on bypassing your softener. Many new homes are constructed with PEX and not copper.</p>
