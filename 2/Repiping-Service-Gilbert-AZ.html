<p>Property owners can ask for a plumbing inspection at any time, however it is specifically prudent to set up inspections on a yearly basis and when acquiring a brand-new home. You need to make certain that you have power running under your sink, including an electric outlet and a switch nearby to turn it on. You'll need to call an electrician to get everything installed if you don't. When sewers and drains are causing problems, Larry & Sons is the solution you need.
