<p>Backflow suggests the undesirable reversal of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the potable water system; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from occurring. Points at which a drinkable water supply connects with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in home appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashers, however they need to be thoroughly created and set up to prevent backflow. Another typical place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public water supply.</p>
