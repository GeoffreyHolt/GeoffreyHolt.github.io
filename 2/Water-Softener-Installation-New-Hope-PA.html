<p>A new sink can dramatically impact the feel and look of a room.

<p>Iron or manganese fouling: Iron or manganese that has actually been exposed to air or chlorine can clog the resin and avoid it from working. This is known as fouling. Sometimes it might be necessary to filter the water before it gets to your softener to prevent fouling. If the resin ends up being fouled, commercial cleaners are offered. Cleaners need to be used according to manufacturer guidelines to prevent contamination.</p>
