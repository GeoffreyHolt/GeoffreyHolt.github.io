Our substantial water quality program operates 24 hr a day, 365 days a year, to make sure that the water provided to our customers is kept devoid of harmful pollutants.

<p>When a flush valve causes a toilet to run, a worn flapper is normally the perpetrator. But not always. First, look at the chain that raises the flapper.
