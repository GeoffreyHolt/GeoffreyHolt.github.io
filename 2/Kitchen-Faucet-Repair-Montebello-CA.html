<p>The toilet takes an actually very long time to flush. Here's how it works: Throughout regular operation, the pressure between the two check valves-- described as the zone of minimized pressure-- is maintained at a lower pressure than the supply pressure. If either check valve should leak, the relief valve is developed to open and release water to the outdoors, ensuring backflow never ever takes place.</p>
<p>When the potable supply piping is connected to a system or component which surpasses the operating pressure of the supply piping, backpressure may occur. Greater pressure can be triggered by booster pumps, boilers, pressure vessels, or raised piping in places such as skyscrapers or tanks. Non-potable and potable water or liquids can be forced into the safe and clean supply system if these connections are not correctly protected.</p>
