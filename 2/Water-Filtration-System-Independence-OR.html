<h3>An Easy Approach To Find A Reliable Plumber Independence OR</h3>
<p>Sometimes called an auger, this helpful tool can clear clogs that may be stuck further down the system. You'll have to take apart the drainpipe and P-trap that runs beneath the kitchen sink to expose the stub pipe" or stubout" that travels behind the cabinet wall. This is where you place the snake into the pipe up until you feel resistance to break up the clog.</p>
<p>Tom of Gotelli Plumbing offered outstanding service for us in changing an extremely balky tub spout, and worn out toilet parts. Not only was he extremely professional and extensive but he had the ability to answer all my concerns concerning the service. If I could, I would provide 6 stars. A camera inspection of your sewer line is one of the most efficient ways of locating the specific location of a plumbing problem. A plumber will insert a specifically created waterproof camera through your sewer line and capture live video to identify where and what the source of the issue is.</p>
