<p>Saint Paul Regional Water Services (SPRWS) requires plumbing contractors to get a plumbing authorization prior to setting up or replacing a backflow preventer.

After travelling through the beads, the resulting chloride solution becomes a waste stream that decreases the drain and ultimately into the environment.</p>
