<h3>What Causes Pipe and Drain Clogs in Orange CA?</h3>
<p>What is difficult water? Clinically speaking, it is water that contains significant quantities of dissolved minerals, particularly calcium and magnesium. As water trickles through rocks, limestone deposits and soil, it gets these minerals on its journey. Depending on how long the water travels through the ground prior to reaching your tap, it can pick up a great deal of these minerals, making water harder in some areas than others. While the minerals will not damage your health, they can leave insoluble mineral deposits, making the water inappropriate-- and quite an annoyance-- for its numerous intended uses around your house.</p>
