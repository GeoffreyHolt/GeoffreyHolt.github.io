I in fact received their number for another company that couldn't come quickly enough but referred me to Cost Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to investigate and give me a price quote. They instantly cleared the initial clog, allowing for the tenants to return from a hotel. Unfortunately, upon additional examination, there was a substantial blockage that needed excavation to examine. His team was on website the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this initial issue and setting up a protective liner, it was figured out that there was yet another break existed. This took place yet a third time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
