<p>During normal operation, the pressure in between the 2 check valves, described as the zone of lowered pressure, is kept at a lower pressure than the supply pressure. If either check valve must leak, the relief valve is designed to open and release water to the exterior. An RPZ will occasionally discharge percentages of water due to change in line pressure up or downstream of the assembly. For this factor, the RPZ must be set up in areas that are exempt to water damage and allow sufficient drainage.</p>
