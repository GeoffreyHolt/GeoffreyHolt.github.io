The typical labor cost to install a gas line is $3 to $11 per direct foot depending on the size of the pipe and job intricacy. Licensed plumbers charge between $45 to $150 per hour, or $100 an hour usually to put new gas lines.</p>
<p>When the only answer to your hot water heater woes is to replace the whole unit, the best recourse is to update to something that is energy efficient.

Current enhancements in water softening technology, however, have reduced this water consumption and showed that there is great prospective for water cost savings. WaterSense thinks there is a chance to profit from this water cost savings opportunity, raise customer awareness, and even more improve the performance of water softeners.</p>
