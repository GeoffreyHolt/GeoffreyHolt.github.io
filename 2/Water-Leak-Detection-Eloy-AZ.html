<p>Some manufacturers claim that the electrical gadgets they produce can impact the interaction of minerals with water so that the minerals do not bind to surface areas. Because these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like traditional water softeners do, one benefit claimed for the user is the elimination of the need to include salt to the system. While particle size decrease and plant growth promo have been claimed, such systems do not eliminate minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can only alter the downstream impacts that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of certain systems has shown a reduction of calcium scale development. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" but rather "water conditioning".</p>
<p>The conventional hot water heater has a tank that is filled with continuously heated water. It squanders energy by holding the temperature of water that is not currently in usage.
