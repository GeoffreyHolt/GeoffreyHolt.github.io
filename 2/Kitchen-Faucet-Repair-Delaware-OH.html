<p>The majority of homes or structures that were constructed in the 1970s generally have galvanized piping. With time, the plumbing system can break and the pipes can start to wear away.

Galvanized piping consists of iron pipes that have actually been coded with zinc to provide weather condition security. As the external covering of zinc begins to wear down, the pipe is exposed to water and wetness, triggering the iron to eventually rust.</p>
