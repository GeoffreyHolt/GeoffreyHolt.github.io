<p>According to the Environmental Protection Agency, cross-connections can be a severe public health hazard if they do not have appropriate backflow prevention assemblies installed. There are many, well-documented cases in which cross-connections have actually been accountable for contamination of drinking water that, when taken in, triggered the spread of illness or disease.</p>
<p>In addition to the garbage disposal system, there are a number of upgrades and parts that you may need to take into account when weighing the waste disposal unit installation cost. For example, a 2-inch service line connected to a 6-inch supply line will have the exact same pressure. If there is a break or high need for the water downstream from the 6-inch service line, then unfavorable or decreased pressure in the 2-inch supply line will trigger a vacuum and follow or siphonage from the service line.</p>
