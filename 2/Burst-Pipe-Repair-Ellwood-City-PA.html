<p>According to the Environmental Protection Agency, cross-connections can be a serious public health hazard if they do not have sufficient backflow prevention assemblies set up. There are various, well-documented cases in which cross-connections have actually been accountable for contamination of drinking water that, when taken in, caused the spread of sickness or disease.</p>
<p>To avoid these things from obstructing your drains and causing damage, Larry & Sons advises that you use hair and food stoppers throughout your house. These nifty additions to your sinks and tubs can minimize the amount of hair and food scraps that end up in your drainpipes. Numerous garbage disposals will require a brand-new sink drain flange, which includes the metal disk at the drain entryway at the bottom of the sink in addition to a brief length of pipe that extends below the sink, where the drain connects.</p>
<p>Galvanized water piping rusts and wears away internally. When drawing water from galvanized water pipes, particles of rust, zinc, and other impurities flow into your drinking water. These contaminants also clog the pipe internally stopping the flow of water to fixtures. After we check the drains and supply of water lines and clean up the area, your new sink will be ready to use!
