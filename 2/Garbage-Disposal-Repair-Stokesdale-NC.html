<p>The primary media consisted of within a water softener is known as ion exchange resin. This resin is essentially an insoluble matrix typically in the shape of small (1-2 mm diameter) beads. The product has actually extremely established structure of pores on the surface of which are sites with quickly trapped and released ions.
