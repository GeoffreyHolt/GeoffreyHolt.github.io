<p>Difficult water is softened by eliminating the calcium and magnesium it consists of. When hard water passes through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (hardness) ions are eliminated through an ion exchange process, so only softened water travels through to your home. As soon as the resin bed fills with hardness ions, it should be regenerated (cleaned up). Salt is normally utilized in the regrowth process and brings back the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange process can start once again.</p>
<p>However, if the clog is further down the sewer line, needing unique equipment to be generated, it will cost more, specifically if floor covering has to be brought up or the toilet needs to be rebuilt.
