<p>In many states, except Kansas, you are responsible for any gas piping on your property from our gas meter to your house or service. Atmos Energy does not keep the natural gas lines on your residential or commercial property beyond our meter, this is the very same as other energies, such as your electrical wiring and pipes. When water enters your home from the main water system line, it must just ever flow in one direction: into your house.</p>
<p>Backpressure backflow is triggered by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's drinkable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the drinkable supply of water pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the drinkable water system pressure, or a combination of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature increases in boilers, and so on. Reductions in drinkable water system pressure take place whenever the quantity of water being utilized surpasses the amount of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
