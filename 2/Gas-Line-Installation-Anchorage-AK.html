<h3>Water Heater Leaking at Anchorage AK? The Way to Diagnose and Fix the Problem Fast!</h3>
<p>What is hard water? Clinically speaking, it is water which contains substantial amounts of liquified minerals, specifically calcium and magnesium. As water trickles through rocks, limestone deposits and soil, it picks up these minerals on its journey. Depending upon the length of time the water takes a trip through the ground before reaching your tap, it can get a lot of these minerals, making water harder in some regions than others. While the minerals won't harm your health, they can leave insoluble mineral deposits, making the water unsuitable-- and quite a nuisance-- for its lots of intended uses around your house.</p>
