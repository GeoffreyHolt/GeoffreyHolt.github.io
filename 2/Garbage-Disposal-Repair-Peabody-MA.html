<h3>How To Choose An Exceptional Plumbing Service Peabody MA</h3>
<p>Backflow means the unfavorable reversal of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the safe and clean water system; a backflow preventer is designed to keep this from taking place. Points at which a drinkable water system connects with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashing machines, but they should be thoroughly created and set up to avoid backflow. Another common place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public supply of water.</p>
