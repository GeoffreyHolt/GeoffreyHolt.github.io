<p>In local water supply systems, water is generally preserved at a significant pressure to enable water to stream to and out of the plumbing fixtures in your home or business. When the pressure drops for some factor such as might take place when the fire department connects to a fire hydrant to eliminate a water or a fire main breaks or some other scenario happens, infected water might be drawn into the system. To avoid such an event, there needs to be some kind of backflow prevention method made use of. The very best and most safe kind of backflow prevention is an air gap (a physical separation in between the water outlet and the rim of the component). If an air gap is not possible, then the proper backflow prevention device is required. This backflow device is considered a containment" backflow preventer and is regulated by the Ohio Epa and your water provider.</p>
