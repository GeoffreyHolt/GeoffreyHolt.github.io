<p>A water softener works by utilizing electrical charges to remove the minerals. Calcium, magnesium and numerous other minerals carry favorable charges, so water softeners use sodium ions, which are "exchanged" with the calcium and magnesium ions.

<p>Water heater diagnostics: We identify what is incorrect with your water heater, as well as what maintenance work needs to be performed moving forward.

<p>Though water line replacement sounds like your home's equivalent of significant surgery, it's really something we at Gotelli Plumbing handle frequently. When your water lines are repiped, it just means old copper and galvanized pipes are replaced with new pipes. We discover that houses 15 years or older who have actually never had repiping work are the most likely candidates for water line replacement. If you have an older house and are experiencing frequent and significant leaks, you might be in need of water line repiping. If you do have frequent leaks, we find that repiping can really be the less expensive and much better long-lasting option.</p>

Our commercial and residential plumbers take care of the rest. In a lot of cases the toilet repair is an affordable part and a couple of adjustments, although adjustments communicate and can be a bit tricky.</p>
