<p>PEX pipes were believed to be a much better option to polybutylene and galvanized piping. Unfortunately, one brand is experiencing a lot of problems: Dura PEX. Dura PEX tends to have a great deal of oxidization. This triggers fractures in the tubing that can lead to leakages. As these leakages occur, zinc is leached from the fittings on the pipes, triggering them to weaken. Lastly, chlorinated water has been discovered to cause fractures in the clamps on these pipes. Repiping is the very best solution to all of these concerns.</p>
<p>Backflow prevention secures drinkable water supply from prospective risks. There are over 10,000 reported cases of backflow contamination each year.
