Merely pour a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, add some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mixture sit for a while. If that doesn't work, you can attempt a non-abrasive toilet bowl cleaner.

It is very important to go out in front of any problems as fast as possible. The quicker you respond to an issue, the better possibility you'll need to conserve time and money on hot water heater services.</p>
