So employing a licensed, insured master plumber (or a well-trained apprentice working under his license) is a no-brainer. However not all plumbers handle all types of work. Their tasks break out into 2 categories: Plumbers who deal with fundamental repairs (often in emergency circumstances), and plumbers who specialize in remodeling jobs and additions.</p>
<p>A new pattern in re-piping is sand blasting the within used thin pipe and the painting the within the worn pipe with epoxy paint. Sometimes throughout the sandblasting the sandblasting will use thin and blow through the wall of pipes and joints. A few of those thin areas leak immediately and sometimes those leaks come days or weeks later. Leaking pipes that are epoxy-coated wind up needing to be correctly re-piped by setting up a CDA copper re-pipe.</p>
