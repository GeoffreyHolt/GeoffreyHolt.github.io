<p>Climatic Vacuum Breaker - Model GFAVB - The climatic vacuum breaker is among the least pricey backflow prevention assembly. The GFAVB is a non-testable unit and are good for back siphonage just for non-health risk or health hazard conditions.

If an GFAVB is utilized backflow prevention on an irrigation system you must install one GFAVB after every valve for each zone in the system.  It must also be set up at least 6 inches (150 mm) higher than the highest outlet in the system (some GFAVB manufacturers, and some local officials, require that they be set up 12 inches (300 mm) greater than the greatest outlet). Some towns do not permit the usage of GFAVB's. These systems will NOT prevent backflow pressure and can just secure versus back siphonage.</p>
<p>Backpressure backflow is caused by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's potable water supply.

Increases in downstream pressure can be developed by pumps, temperature boosts in boilers, etc. Decreases in safe and clean supply of water pressure take place whenever the quantity of water being utilized surpasses the quantity of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
