When setting up the plumbing to your softener, take your time and ensure your fittings are threaded well and your push-to-connect fittings are seated properly.

A broken rotor valve or rotor valve seal may also be the culprit. The rotor valve directs the water throughout the system during softening and regrowth procedures. A worn water valve can secure and spring a leak. It is most likely broken and just needs to be changed if the rotor valve's seal is leaking.</p>
