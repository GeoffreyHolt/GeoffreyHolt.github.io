<p>Climatic vacuum breakers (AVB) are the simplest style of backflow preventer. If you have less than 6 control valves, they are the least expensive, but also the least reliable option. These devices are not created as a whole-system backflow prevention valve; one must be set up at every control valve. Sprinkler Warehouse does not recommend AVB's for irrigations systems where there is a potential to infect drinking water. AVB's are not testable and it is not possible to identify when one has actually stopped working.</p>
<p>Tough water is softened by eliminating the calcium and magnesium it includes. When difficult water travels through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (hardness) ions are gotten rid of through an ion exchange procedure, so only softened water passes through to your house. When the resin bed fills with solidity ions, it should be regrowed (cleaned). Salt is typically used in the regrowth procedure and restores the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange process can begin again.</p>
