<p>The High Voltage Leak Detection Innovation (HVLD) testing procedure consists of a set of electrode probes which scans a sealed container made of a non-conductive product. Some disposer units do not come with a power cable attached. If this is the case, eliminate the plate with a screwdriver to access the electrical circuitry (Image 1). Make sure to purchase an electrical wiring package with the appropriate power rating and hardware for your disposer system (Images 2 and 3). Guarantee the cable is long enough to reach the receptacle without extending the cord when you connect the electrical wiring harness to the disposer.</p>

<p>. Backflow into a public water system can contaminate the water or pollute in that system (i.e., backflow into a public water supply can make the water in that system unusable or unsafe to consume), and each water provider has a duty to supply water that is usable and safe to drink under all foreseeable situations. Additionally, customers usually have outright faith that water provided to them through a public water supply is always safe to consume. For these reasons, your water district should take safety measures to protect its public water system versus backflow.</p>
<p>According to the Environmental Protection Agency, cross-connections can be a severe public health danger if they do not have adequate backflow prevention assemblies installed. There are many, well-documented cases in which cross-connections have actually been responsible for contamination of drinking water that, when consumed, triggered the spread of sickness or illness.</p>
