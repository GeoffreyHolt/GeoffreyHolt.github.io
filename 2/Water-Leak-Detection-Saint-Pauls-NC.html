<p>Another disadvantage of water softening through ion exchange is the possible health risk for individuals on low salt diets. Ion exchange increases the amount of sodium in water, in order to lower its mineral content. Normally, this process adds 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending on how difficult the water was to start with. Harder water will result in more salt, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For the majority of people, this increase in salt is minor, however if you've been encouraged by a physician to follow a strict low salt diet this boost can pose problems.</p>

<p>Root Intrusion: Root invasion describes what takes place when tree roots begin to grow around and into your drain and sewer lines This occurs since the moisture in these lines is a natural fertilizer for tree roots. When roots ultimately do piece your drain lines, they can cause obstructions, breaks, and back-ups which may lead to comprehensive home damage.

<h3>How To Keep Bathroom Sinks Running Smoothly at Saint Pauls NC</h3>
<p>Unbreakable Obstructions: Professional help is the best treatment, if you find yourself provided with a particularly persistent clog. You might wind up doing more damage than good if you continue to combat with it, which can develop irreversible problems. If you do not have a skilled appearance into your clog situation, sewage back-flow is another major concern.</p>
<p>In the sinks, showers, and tubs in your house, the clogs occur because hair and soap accumulate in the drains. Is your hot water heater draining pipes effectively? Our plumbers understand the best techniques to clear the drains from these issues. When the water will not drain from the shower tray, there is no way to take a shower. We will have your drains cleared rapidly, so you can when again take a shower.</p>
<p>To prep your unit for installation, you may need to connect a cable with a plug to reach the outlet, or extension wires to reach a hardwired box In this case, I connected a cord with a plug kit that I purchased individually from the disposal unit. It's as simple as feeding the wires from the cord through the disposal and attaching them to the matching colors on the unit with wire nuts.</p>
