<p>So, how does a softener know when to get down to service? The timing of regrowth depends on the type of softener you have. Softeners with a timer flush and recharge on the basis of a fixed schedule-- state, 11 p.m. every three days, despite whether the water actually needs it. When required, more recent units use digital sensing units that keep track of bead depletion and other crucial metrics based on your water use and for that reason only restore. These newer systems, also described as demand-initiated regrowth softeners, are ideal since they save energy and money-- utilizing less water and salt for regeneration.</p>
