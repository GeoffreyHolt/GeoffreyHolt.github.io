<p>Backflow indicates the undesirable reversal of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the potable water system; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from taking place. Points at which a drinkable water system connects with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in devices such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, however they should be carefully developed and installed to prevent backflow. Another common place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public supply of water.</p>

<p>Though water line replacement seems like your house's equivalent of major surgery, it's in fact something we at Gotelli Plumbing deal with often. When your water lines are repiped, it just implies old copper and galvanized pipes are replaced with brand-new pipes. We find that houses 15 years or older who have never had repiping work are the most likely candidates for water line replacement. You could be in need of water line repiping if you have an older home and are experiencing major and frequent leakages. We discover that repiping can actually be the cheaper and much better long-term solution if you do have frequent leakages.</p>

<p>Other signs you might need to repipe include rust in your water system, low water pressure, and damp spots in your walls, floor, or ceiling. While these are common signs that precede repiping services, they do not necessarily imply repiping is the only service. Contact our Brenham plumbers and we will have a look at the problem to determine the very best course of action.</p>
