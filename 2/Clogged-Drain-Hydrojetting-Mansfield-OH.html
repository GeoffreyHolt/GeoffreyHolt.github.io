More recent units use computerized sensing units that keep track of bead exhaustion and other key metrics based upon your water use and therefore just regenerate when needed. These more recent systems, also described as demand-initiated regrowth softeners, are ideal because they conserve energy and money-- using less water and salt for regrowth.</p>
