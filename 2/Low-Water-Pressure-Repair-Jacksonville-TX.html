<p>You reside in an older home. If your house is 50 years old or older and you have actually never ever changed its pipes, there's a great chance that you'll need to have it done soon. Galvanized pipes were most often set up in houses of this age, and these types of pipes are known to rust and burst when they get old. If so, you may need to add a grounded outlet to power the garbage disposal if you don't currently have one. This normally adds anywhere from $75 to $150+ to the overall cost of the garbage disposal installation.</p>
