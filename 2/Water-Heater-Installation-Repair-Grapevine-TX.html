<p>Obvious odor. The moment you smell sewage (a rotten egg-like smell) in the yard, basement, or throughout your home or business place, offer us a call. That odor may be coming from your sewer system, which needs repair work immediately. If your vent stack, the part of your plumbing system that removes sewage from your home, launches sewer gas, and regulates air pressure in the waste-system pipes has stopped working, it will frequently need to be replaced rather than repaired. If your pipes are gurgling or releasing nasty smells, you'll know this.</p>
