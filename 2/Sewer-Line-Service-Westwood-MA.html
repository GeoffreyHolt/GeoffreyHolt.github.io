Based on research performed by the Water Quality Association (WQA) Water Softener Benefits Research Study, 2011.</p>
<p>The EcoWater ESS1152 Series are non-resin based systems that can be tailored to your water requires. Your EcoWater Pro will evaluate your water to identify the best water treatment for your house.
