<p>Foul Sewer Odor: One of the first most apparent signs of a sewer issue is an odor of sewage when you flush the toilet, or in the lawn (in the area where your sewer line would be). This can be a simple issue such as a broken water seal, or it can show a bigger concern such as a broken sewer pipe. Drain repairs can avoid severe damage to your home. Even if the issue originates with the municipal system, it's still smart to bring in the experts to limit the damage to your home.</p>
<p>You'll notice that water runs to fill up the bowl Whenever you flush your toilet. Nevertheless, in a correctly working toilet, the water should stop running when the bowl is filled to its proper capacity.

These leaks are very wasteful, as more than a hundred gallons of water end up traveling through the overflow.</p>
