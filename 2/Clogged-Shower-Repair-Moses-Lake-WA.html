<p>We focus on repair, service and installation of all makes and models of gas water heaters, electric water heaters and tankless hot water heater. Carefully flex the float arm down to put extra pressure on the toilet valve. (To change a float that does not have an arm, see Picture 8.) Then flush the toilet to see if it works.

<p>Loose flanges are usually the result of wood rot. The flange screws simply won't hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The very best solution depends on the degree of the rot. If the rot is only under the flange, use an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into company wood further away from the flange. Before you install this sort of ring, hold it as much as the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might need to cut off a couple of ears to make it work with your toilet. You'll have to replace a section of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>
