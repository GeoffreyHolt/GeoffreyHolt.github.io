No, it is not a frequent occurrence, but it does take place more often than you think! When you do not notice the water was off for a couple of minutes, often it happens at night. An example is when the public utility has to shut off the water to repair a pipes, or connect a new pipe. This makes construction tasks quickly the most typical reason for backflow problems. Fire fighting is another common reason for backflow. Fire engine use substantial pumps to suck the water out of the fire hydrants.
