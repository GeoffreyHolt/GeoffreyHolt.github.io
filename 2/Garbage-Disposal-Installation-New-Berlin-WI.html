<h3>Why You Need Trustworthy Plumbing Services New Berlin WI</h3>
<p>The leak from a pipe fitting that costs less than a dollar can quickly cause countless dollars in water damage, interrupt your household for weeks, and toss your remodel way off schedule. So employing a licensed, insured master plumber (or a well-trained apprentice working under his license) is a no-brainer. But not all plumbers handle all types of work. Their responsibilities break out into 2 classifications: Plumbers who deal with basic repairs (frequently in emergency circumstances), and plumbers who focus on redesigning additions and tasks.</p>
<p>Water softeners work through a process called ion exchange which removes calcium and magnesium from the water. When the hard water enters into the mineral tank, it flows through a bed of spherical resin beads These plastic beads, usually made from polystyrene, are charged with a sodium ion. The resin beads are anions, implying they have a negative charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a favorable charge, making them cations. Because opposite charges draw in, the negative charge of the minerals is brought in to the positive charge of the resin beads. As the hard water goes through the resin, the beads grab ahold of the mineral ions and remove them from the water. When the bead seizes the mineral ion, the salt ion is launched. The column of resin strips all the solidity out of the water as it travels through the mineral tank, and softened water drains into your home.</p>
