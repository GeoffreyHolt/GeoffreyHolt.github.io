<p>A lot of houses or buildings that were built in the 1970s typically have galvanized piping. In time, the plumbing system can wear out and the pipes can begin to wear away.

As the outer coating of zinc starts to wear down, the pipe is exposed to water and moisture, triggering the iron to ultimately rust.</p>
