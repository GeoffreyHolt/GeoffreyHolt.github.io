<p>Backflow suggests the unwanted turnaround of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the drinkable water supply; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from taking place. Points at which a safe and clean water system connects with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashers, but they must be carefully created and installed to avoid backflow. Another common location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public water system.</p>
<p>To plumb the disposer's drain outlet, fit the rubber washer over the flanged end of the plastic crosspiece, then move the metal flange on from the other end. Pointer the bottom of the metal flange into its slot in the disposer and tighten up the securing bolt through the top of the flange.
