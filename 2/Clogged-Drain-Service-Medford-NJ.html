Blanc also developed a much bigger version of the Roto-Rooter machine called the Roto-Rooter Royal. It needed to be towed by a truck and featured a 10 hp gas engine and 1000 feet of steel cable television. It can cleaning big industrial and local sewer pipes.

<p>Backpressure is developed when pressure in a water supply exceeds the pressure in the drinkable system providing the makeup water. This can force the potable water to reverse its direction of circulation through the cross-connection between the two systems. Potential impurities can then get in the potable water system.

<p>Take the example of the instant hot shower that uses the point-of-use hot water heater; these appliances will supply warm water continually for the duration you are using the shower.
