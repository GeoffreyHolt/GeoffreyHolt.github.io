<h3>24 Hour Emergency Plumbing Melrose Park IL</h3>

<p>Backpressure backflow is caused by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's potable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the drinkable supply of water pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the potable supply of water pressure, or a mix of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be developed by pumps, temperature boosts in boilers, etc. Reductions in drinkable water system pressure occur whenever the amount of water being used surpasses the amount of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
