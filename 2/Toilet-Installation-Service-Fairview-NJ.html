<p>Backpressure backflow is caused by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's safe and clean water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the potable water supply pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable supply of water pressure, or a combination of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature level increases in boilers, and so on. Reductions in safe and clean supply of water pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being used surpasses the amount of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
