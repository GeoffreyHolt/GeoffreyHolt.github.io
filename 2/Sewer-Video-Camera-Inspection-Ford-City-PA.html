<p>House water softeners, likewise called ion exchange systems, are devices that remove calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for salt or potassium.

After passing through the beads, the resulting chloride option ends up being a waste stream that decreases the drain and eventually into the environment.</p>
