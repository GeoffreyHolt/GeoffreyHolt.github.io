<h3>Most Typical Plumbing Services Gig Harbor WA</h3>

Points at which a potable water supply connects with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashers, but they must be thoroughly created and installed to prevent backflow. Another typical location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public supply of water.</p>
<p>The easiest mechanical backflow prevention device is the vacuum breaker assembly (VBA). It has one moving part, a portable disc connected to an atmospheric vent.

This sets off the disc to open, enabling air to bring back and go into the valve pressure comparable to ambient climatic requirement. This repair of pressure breaks the siphon and avoids cross contamination.</p>
