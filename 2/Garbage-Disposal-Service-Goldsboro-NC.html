<p>Backflow preventers are crucial for producing a safe water system system. No matter which model you choose, all water softeners need to be correctly preserved. The brine solution must be mixed and kept in the brine tank. Routine clogging of the resin likewise requires unique attention. For example, if the raw supply of water is turbid it may clog the resin with mud and clay. Sometimes, normal backwashing with water will solve this problem. If not, gradually stir the resin throughout the backwash cycle to help separate the material. Also, fungis and bacteria also form mats in the resin that lower its efficiency. Decontaminating the water prior to softening or periodically cleaning the softener with chlorine bleach will eliminate these nuisances. Nevertheless, read the manufacturer's directions before including any chemicals to the unit.</p>
<p>As water goes through the supply pipes and then out the faucets, showerheads, icemaker, washing machine, water heater, boiler, and dishwasher, it's leaving behind hard, crusty mineral deposits.

In extreme cases, hard-water deposits can drastically limit the water circulation, which puts excessive pressure on the whole plumbing system.</p>
