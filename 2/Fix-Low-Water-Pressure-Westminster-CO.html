<p>There's no part of your home that has more of a direct effect on your security, convenience, comfort, and dependability than your plumbing system. This is incredibly important! When you have actually cast iron drain lines you need 3-5 gallons of water that an older toilet offers to press the waste out of your drain system. Existing policies restrict the amount of water a toilet can utilize per flush to 1.28 gallons per flush which can leave particles piling up in cast iron drain lines. We provide two kinds of water treatment systems for hard water: Benefit Series Seawater Softeners and NaturSoft ® Water Softener Alternatives.</p>

<p>A partial reroute is basically a little scale repiping of one or more afflicted areas of the plumbing beneath the slab. In cases where fixing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost effective, it is possible to only abandon the afflicted area of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, walls and attics. Costing less than a complete repipe, completion result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak once again in the future. We have actually experienced homes having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can build up in cost really rapidly. This is the main reason that we will advise a full repipe in particular areas, based upon our experience.</p>
