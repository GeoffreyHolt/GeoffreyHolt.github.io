<p>The High Voltage Leak Detection Innovation (HVLD) testing process consists of a set of electrode probes which scans a sealed container made of a non-conductive product. Some disposer systems do not featured a power cable attached. Get rid of the plate with a screwdriver to access the electrical wiring (Image 1) if this is the case. Make sure to buy an electrical wiring package with the correct power rating and hardware for your disposer unit (Images 2 and 3). Make sure the cord is long enough to reach the receptacle without stretching the cord when you link the electrical wiring harness to the disposer.</p>
