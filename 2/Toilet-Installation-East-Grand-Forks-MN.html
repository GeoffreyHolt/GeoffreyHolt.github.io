To simply pour some media inside a tank and wish for the very best is typical in our industry and many companies attempt to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Once again, years of experience and extensive testing led us to create a tank that fluidizes the media bed much better than any other design on the marketplace.
