<p>The most effective way to address difficult water is with a water softener. Water is softened when calcium and magnesium-- the hardness ions-- are collected by tiny resin beads through a process called ion exchange. The resin beads are charged with salt or potassium ions. When hard water is available in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are taken out of the water and changed with salt or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>In local water system systems, water is typically maintained at a considerable pressure to enable water to stream to and out of the plumbing fixtures in your home or company. When the pressure drops for some reason such as may take place when the fire department links to a fire hydrant to combat a water or a fire main breaks or some other situation occurs, polluted water might be drawn into the system. To avoid such an incident, there needs to be some kind of backflow prevention technique utilized. The best and safest type of backflow prevention is an air gap (a physical separation in between the water outlet and the rim of the component). If an air space is not possible, then the appropriate backflow prevention device is needed. This backflow device is considered a containment" backflow preventer and is regulated by the Ohio Epa and your water provider.</p>
