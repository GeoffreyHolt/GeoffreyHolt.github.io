Fire defense system are designed to match the hazard that exists in the places they are installed in. As building types and contents of these buildings can be very various, we need to understand that the fire protection system for any installation needs to be designed and set up to fulfill that specific risk or need. An airplane hangar will need a very different fire security system than the system needed in an apartment building. The backflow security requirements for these two examples would likewise vary considerably.</p>
