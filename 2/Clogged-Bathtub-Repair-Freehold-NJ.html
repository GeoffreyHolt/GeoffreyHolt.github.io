<p>Some manufacturers claim that the electrical devices they produce can impact the interaction of minerals with water so that the minerals do not bind to surfaces. Since these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like traditional water softeners do, one advantage claimed for the user is the elimination of the need to add salt to the system. While particle size decrease and plant growth promotion have been declared, such systems do not eliminate minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can just modify the downstream impacts that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have.

<p>I had a major sewer concern with a 1940s home, with rainwater and sewage was supporting into the basement shower. I began calling any number I might discover on Google. I really got their number for another company that could not come soon enough but referred me to Rate Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to examine and give me an estimate. They immediately cleared the initial clog, allowing for the tenants to return from a hotel. Sadly, upon further investigation, there was a considerable clog that required excavation to investigate. His group was on site the extremely next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this initial problem and installing a protective liner, it was identified that there was yet another break existed. This took place yet a third time as they worked their method through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
