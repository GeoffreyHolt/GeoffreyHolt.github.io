The GFAVB is a non-testable system and are good for back siphonage just for non-health danger or health threat conditions. They must be set up downstream from any turned off valves and can not be under pressure for more than 12 hours. If an GFAVB is used backflow prevention on a watering system you need to install one GFAVB after every valve for each zone in the system.  It must also be installed a minimum of 6 inches (150 mm) higher than the highest outlet in the system (some GFAVB manufacturers, and some local officials, require that they be set up 12 inches (300 mm) higher than the highest outlet).
