<p>Water softeners resolve a procedure called ion exchange which removes calcium and magnesium from the water. When the difficult water participates in the mineral tank, it streams through a bed of spherical resin beads These plastic beads, generally made from polystyrene, are charged with a salt ion. The resin beads are anions, indicating they have an unfavorable charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a favorable charge, making them cations. Given that opposite charges draw in, the unfavorable charge of the minerals is brought in to the favorable charge of the resin beads. As the hard water passes through the resin, the beads get ahold of the mineral ions and remove them from the water. When the bead takes the mineral ion, the salt ion is launched. The column of resin strips all the solidity out of the water as it travels through the mineral tank, and softened water drains into your house.</p>

<p>In the meantime, however, we recommend you first try utilizing non-abrasive and non-harsh white vinegar and lemon juice with baking soda. Just pour a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, add some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mixture sit for a while. You can attempt a non-abrasive toilet bowl cleaner if that does not work.
