You could be squandering money with every flush if your toilet was made prior to 1994. Older toilets use up to 3.5 gallons per flush-- more than double the modern standard. A Broken Dip Tube: The dip tube is used to vent all of the fresh water from the water line to the bottom of your tank so that it can warm quicker. It is most likely that your dip tube is broken if you discover that cold water is coming out of your faucet even when you are turning the hot knob.</p>
<p>The drain valve (Image 2) on old water heaters often clogs up. Be patient if the water drains slowly. CARE: It's scalding hot!

A leaking toilet is another typical issue house owners experience. After you flush, if the water continues to run, this more than likely means your toilet has a leak. This concern is typically brought on by a rusty pipe, flush valve assembly or as simple as a worn out flapper valve.</p>
<p>Pre-action sprinkler systems normally are set up in locations where water might trigger devastating damage, such as in freezers, computer system spaces, and areas with electronic equipment. The piping in a pre-action system contains air or nitrogen, which can be pressurized or non-pressurized. Water to the system is held back by the pre-action valve, which is connected to a fire detection system. If a fire occurs, the detection system sends out a signal that opens the pre-action valve, which then enables water into the system's piping. The water is discharged through the open sprinkler.</p>

<p>Backpressure backflow is caused by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's drinkable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the safe and clean supply of water pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable supply of water pressure, or a combination of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature level increases in boilers, and so on. Reductions in potable water supply pressure take place whenever the amount of water being used goes beyond the amount of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
