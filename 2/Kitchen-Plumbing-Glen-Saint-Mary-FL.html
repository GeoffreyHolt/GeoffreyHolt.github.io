<p>A variety of organizations, such as the American Water Functions Association (AWWA) and the American Backflow Prevention Association (ABPA) offer certification courses created to train professionals to check backflow preventers. Requirements for training differ by jurisdiction. Inspection of backflow preventers needs understanding of installation requirements, although inspectors are not needed to end up being certified.</p>
<p>Mechanical backflow preventers have internal seals, springs and moving parts that go through fouling, wear or fatigue. Likewise, mechanical backflow preventers and air spaces can be bypassed.
