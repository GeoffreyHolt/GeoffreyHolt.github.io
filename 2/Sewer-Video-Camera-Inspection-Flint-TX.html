However, debris in between the # 1 Examine Valve seat and sealing disc, or damage in the elements, is preventing the # 1 Check from closing all the way. This enables pressure to equalize in between the Supply Side and the Zone of Decreased Pressure. When this occurs, the Relief Valve Spring pushes back versus the Relief Valve Diaphram, opening the Recreational Vehicle Discharge.</p>
