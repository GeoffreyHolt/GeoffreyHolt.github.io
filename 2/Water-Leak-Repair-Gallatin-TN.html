<p>A pressure vacuum breaker (PVB) is thought about a testable backflow preventer, however it is also very unusual. They were produced so as to provide the plumber a testable vacuum breaker device. When it comes to the threat, this device covers harmful as well as non-hazardous scenarios. But simply as with the AVB it can not handle back pressure, only back siphonage.</p>
<p>Maintenance is another consideration. While you can buy models with unique features that do whatever but add the salt, you will spend for each additional function. The tradeoff will be cost for convenience and you have no longterm warranty that the unique feature will not fail. Depending on the water source, you might need to filter turbid water or disinfect bacteria-laden water-all before it even reaches the softening system. Finally, if you own a septic tank, you ought to consider the extra load on your drainage field from backwashing and regrowth. Estimates indicate that about 50 gallons of water are used for each regeneration cycle. This might or might not cause hydraulic overload of the septic tank.</p>
