Considering that the overflow tube is seldom the reason for a running toilet, we will not cover that repair here.</p>

<p>He dug 2 holes on either side of the pipe and was able to blast the old, damaged pipe out while changing it with a brand-new one at the very same time. We did a follow-up call to the property owner a number of weeks later, and she reported no excess water in her lawn. Task well done: You don't want to end up with gunk and water all over your kitchen floor. Leaving the job to a qualified plumber ensures a smooth installation process.</p>
<p>Inspections avoid a high percentage of plumbing emergencies. There are some things you can do for your hot water heater to help it run correctly. It is important to ensure there is always 2 feet of clearance around it. You must also drain about 25 percent of your tank frequently (a couple of times each year). This will help eliminate any sediment that has actually settled inside the tank.</p>
<p>Single flush High Efficiency Toilets (HETs) utilize 1.28 gallons per flush. The most recent dual flush HET provided by Bonney will use approximately 1.1 gallons per flush. This is where we disagree with InSinkErator. We recommend, as many plumbers do, to utilize disposals sparingly. Proper care and waste disposal unit maintenance will keep it running long past its warranty and keep your drain lines clear.</p>
