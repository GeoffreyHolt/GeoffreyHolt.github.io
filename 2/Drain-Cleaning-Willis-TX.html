That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Once again, years of experience and extensive testing led us to create a tank that fluidizes the media bed better than any other style on the marketplace. Fluidization is the key to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media converts the solidity in the water to calcite crystals which will not stay with anything even under extreme temperature levels. It's just with the media and the fluidization effectively interacting that you can achieve this.</p>
