<h3>Looking For A Plumber In Crestwood KY</h3>
<p>Backflow implies the unwanted turnaround of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the safe and clean water system; a backflow preventer is designed to keep this from taking place. Points at which a potable water supply connects with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in home appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashing machines, however they must be thoroughly designed and set up to prevent backflow. Another common location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public water system.</p>
<p>Yes, anywhere connections are or can be made between the potable water supply and non-potable water or compounds a backflow assembly is required to be set up. An authorized, properly installed and maintained backflow assembly basically removes the hazard of backflow from either backpressure or backsiphonage. Ensure that the softener is filled with sodium or potassium chloride following the producer's recommendations.</p>
