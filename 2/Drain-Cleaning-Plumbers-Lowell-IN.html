<p>You have to spend at least $50 to get a top quality kitchen sink basket strainer assembly with a resilient finish and a reliable stopper system.

The twist-and-drop style is much easier to use but requires occasional -ring replacement.</p>

<p>From the above description of the working of a toilet, you can see that it is made up of a number of mechanical parts which, with time, go through wear and tear and may need to be changed.

<p>Throughout installation, water and electrical energy are turned off to the area. The old plumbing and sink flange are removed and cleaned of any putty. Loosen the nuts that link the drain pipe, including the curved trap, at the sink drain and near the wall or floor. Use your hands for PVC connections or a pipe wrench for metal connections. Place a pail underneath the drain pipe to catch any water that leakages out.</p>
