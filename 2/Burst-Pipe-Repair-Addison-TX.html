<p>Every factory and every household utilizes water, and none of it is pure. Your hot water heater is used every day and ought to be maintained yearly to analyze wear and tear. Maintenance does not just assist avoid unexpected breakdowns; it also keeps warranties from voiding and assists add years to the life of a system.

<p>The normal service is to have the malfunctioning pipes changed when you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes. Nevertheless, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes changed, which is where whole-house repiping can be found in. This is an alternative to consider if you live in an older home - such as one built pre-1970 - or any house with galvanized steel plumbing.

PG&E typically does this when plumbing in their gas meters.</p>
