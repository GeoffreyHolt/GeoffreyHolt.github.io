<p>Root Invasion: Root invasion refers to what occurs when tree roots begin to grow around and into your drain and sewer lines This occurs due to the fact that the wetness in these lines is a natural fertilizer for tree roots. When roots eventually do piece your drain lines, they can trigger clogs, breaks, and back-ups which might lead to substantial home damage.
