Your toilet may end up being stopped due to excess paper being flushed, or you could have a house-wide backup caused by sewage returning up through the pipes.</p>
<p>To make placing a toilet easier, brand-new toilet bolts are extra long. That indicates you need to cut off the extending ends later on with a hacksaw.

<p>Sometimes, our service technicians will advise that you replace your water heater rather than buy repairs.

Often a bothersome toilet simply requires a small adjustment and life is back to regular.
