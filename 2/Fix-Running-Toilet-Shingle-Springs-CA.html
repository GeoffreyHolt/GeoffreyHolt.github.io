<p>Though water line replacement sounds like your house's equivalent of major surgery, it's really something we at Gotelli Plumbing handle regularly. When your water lines are repiped, it simply indicates old copper and galvanized pipes are replaced with brand-new pipes. We find that homes 15 years or older who have actually never ever had repiping work are the most likely prospects for water line replacement. If you have an older house and are experiencing regular and significant leakages, you might be in need of water line repiping. If you do have frequent leakages, we find that repiping can really be the cheaper and better long-term option.</p>
<p>To prep your system for installation, you might have to attach a cord with a plug to reach the outlet, or extension wires to reach a hardwired box In this case, I attached a cord with a plug set that I bought independently from the disposal unit. It's as easy as feeding the wires from the cord through the disposal and attaching them to the matching colors on the system with wire nuts.</p>
