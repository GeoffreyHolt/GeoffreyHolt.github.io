<p>New houses constructed with copper pipes are specifically prone to corrosive water conditions since the copper pipes have not had a chance to become covered within. As suggested by the MDH, it is best NOT to soften the water in a new home for a duration of three to 5 months after occupancy. This can be done by merely bypassing the water softener's filter medium. See your owner's manual for instructions on bypassing your softener. Lots of new homes are constructed with PEX and not copper.</p>
