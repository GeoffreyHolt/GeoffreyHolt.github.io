<p>Tru-Soft ® Solar Brine Blocks are produced for the requirements of many water softener systems. Recent Review: Howard, the Project Supervisor, has always been practical and useful regarding all our concerns. He did the proposal and arranged the work for the clean out and partial sewer line repair immediately. It is always a pleasure to work with him. Derek snaked the laundry line and outside kitchen sink line which has a "Y". He was able to get a snake around the "Y", which numerous plumbers say they can't do, and clear the line. He is always pleasant, professional and goes above and beyond.</p>

Easements (normally 10 feet large) where main sewage systems traverse personal property are an exception to this rule.</p>
