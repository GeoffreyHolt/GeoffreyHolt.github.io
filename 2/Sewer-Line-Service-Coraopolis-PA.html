<h3>Clearing Blocked Drains in Coraopolis PA</h3>
<p>Ritz Plumbing is a respected name in the Los Angeles area. Our company has actually established a brand name image that exudes quality service at competitive and fair rates. As one of the best plumbers in the Los Angeles area, our plumbers focus on providing energy effective solutions that are cost reliable for the consumer. Low Circulation Toilets: While low circulation toilets are excellent at saving you money on your water costs, some older models do not have the flushing power to effectively get rid of waste, which leads to accumulations.</p>
<p>If you're buying a new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the vast majority of toilets, the drain is focused about 12 in. from the wall. But with a couple of models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To check the rough-in, simply determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't approximately 12 in.. The majority of house centers bring just one or two 10-in. models and no 14-in. designs. If you need to special-order a toilet, be prepared to spend far more. If there's a door near the toilet, also determine how far the bowl protrudes from the wall. If you are replacing a toilet with a standard bowl with a lengthened" design, the door may not close. Keep reading to discover how to install a toilet.</p>
