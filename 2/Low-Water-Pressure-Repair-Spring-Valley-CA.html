<p>Water softeners work through a procedure called ion exchange which removes calcium and magnesium from the water. When the tough water enters into the mineral tank, it flows through a bed of round resin beads These plastic beads, typically made from polystyrene, are charged with a salt ion. The resin beads are anions, indicating they have a negative charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a positive charge, making them cations. Considering that opposite charges attract, the negative charge of the minerals is drawn in to the favorable charge of the resin beads. As the tough water goes through the resin, the beads grab ahold of the mineral ions and eliminate them from the water. When the bead takes the mineral ion, the salt ion is launched. The column of resin strips all the hardness out of the water as it passes through the mineral tank, and softened water drains into your home.</p>
