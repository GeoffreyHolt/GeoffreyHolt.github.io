<p>Other pipe repair strategies include our Pipe Pull method and pipe relining. The Pipe Pull technique interchanges harmed sewer or water lines with new piping by the use of a small hole at the front and back of the piping run. The broken sewer line guides the brand-new piping into location. All new replacement pipes have a predicted life expectancy of one hundred years and are code compliant, chemical-resistant, root-resistant, and leak proof. Another efficient method is pipe relining. Pipe relining basically gets rid of the need for broken pipe elimination. By placing a hardening lining material which coats the within the existing pipe, a brand-new pipe is developed inside the broken one.</p>
