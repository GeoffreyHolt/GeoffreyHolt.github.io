If you have 2 meters, potable and watering, you are likewise required to have 2 backflow preventers, one at each meter.</p>

<p>I had a major sewer concern with a 1940s house, with rainwater and sewage was backing up into the basement shower. I began calling any number I might find on Google. I actually got their number for another company that could not come quickly enough but referred me to Cost Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to investigate and give me a price quote. They right away cleared the preliminary blockage, enabling the tenants to return from a hotel. Regrettably, upon additional examination, there was a significant clog that required excavation to investigate. His team was on website the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this initial concern and installing a protective liner, it was identified that there was yet another break existed. This occurred yet a 3rd time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
