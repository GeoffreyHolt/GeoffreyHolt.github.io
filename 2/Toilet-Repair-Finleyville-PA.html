<h3>Water Heater Leaking at Finleyville PA? The Way to Diagnose and Fix the Problem Fast!</h3>
<p>Button Plumbing was great. They changed my kitchen faucet and included 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had always leaked in the past if I turned off the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were very friendly and got the work done rapidly. The price was rather reasonable. I will absolutely use them for any future plumbing needs. I was very happy with their service.</p>
