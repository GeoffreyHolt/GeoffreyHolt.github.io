The test procedure is a diagnostic examination of the operations of a backflow preventer. When the backflow preventer fails to fulfill this minimum standard, the backflow preventer must be fixed or if necessary, changed. These minimum standards are set at a level that as the backflow prevention assembly starts to weaken in its performance, it can still avoid backflow.
