In cases where fixing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost efficient, it is possible to just desert the affected area of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, ceilings and walls. Costing less than a full repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak once again in the future. We have actually experienced homes having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can accumulate in cost extremely rapidly. This is the main reason that we will advise a full repipe in particular neighborhoods, based upon our experience.</p>

More recent systems use digital sensing units that keep an eye on bead exhaustion and other crucial metrics based upon your water usage and therefore just regrow when needed. These more recent systems, likewise referred to as demand-initiated regrowth softeners, are perfect since they save energy and cash-- using less water and salt for regrowth.</p>
