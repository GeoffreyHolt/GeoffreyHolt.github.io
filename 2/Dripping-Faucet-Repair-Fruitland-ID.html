When roots eventually do piece your drain lines, they can cause clogs, breaks, and back-ups which might result in comprehensive property damage. Look out for wet, green spots in your backyard, a consistent sewage odor in or around your house, an uptick in insect and rodent activity, and slow drains, as these are all common indications of root invasion.</p>
