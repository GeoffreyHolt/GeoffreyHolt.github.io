Our comprehensive water quality program operates 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, to make sure that the water delivered to our consumers is kept free from harmful impurities. A vital part of our water quality program is the backflow prevention program When a water line is connected to devices containing a nonpotable compound, this is called a cross-connection. Contamination might happen when water streams through a cross-connection from a nonpotable source, such as a sprinkler system or cooling and heating system, into the drinkable water supply. This can happen through a process called backflow.</p>
