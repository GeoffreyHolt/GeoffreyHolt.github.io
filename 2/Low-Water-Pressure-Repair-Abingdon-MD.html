If you do not have an expert appearance into your clog circumstance, sewage back-flow is another significant concern.</p>
<p>A & frac13; HP or 1/2 HP waste disposal unit system can grind soft, non-fibrous foods. There is very little insulation in the weaker designs. Here are some common types of garbage disposals you might wish to consider. There are generally 2 kinds of disposals: aluminum and stainless steel.

<p>Single flush High Effectiveness Toilets (HETs) utilize 1.28 gallons per flush. The current double flush HET provided by Bonney will utilize approximately 1.1 gallons per flush.

Correct care and waste disposal unit maintenance will keep it running long past its service warranty and keep your drain lines clear.</p>
